\section*{Introduction}

% What is the big picture problem and why is it important? 
The mechanisms underlying molecular transport within the intracranial
space are fundamental to human brain health and
function. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease are all associated with
abnormal accumulation of protein aggregates together with alterations
in transport and clearance
characteristics~\cite{rasmussen2018glymphatic, harrison2020impaired,
  eide2023plasma, liu2024glymphatic}. Moreover, sleep and conversely
sleep-deprivation play a definite yet enigmatic role in modulating
molecular enrichment and clearance~\cite{xie2013sleep, eide2021sleep,
  eide2022altered, miao2024brain}. In the last decade, established
theories have been challenged by new findings revealing a greater
degree of molecular movement and exchange~\cite{iliff2012paravascular,
  ringstad2017glymphatic, louveau2017understanding,
  proulx2021cerebrospinal, bohr2022glymphatic}, as well as substantial
variability in enrichment and clearance between individuals and
between patient cohorts~\cite{ringstad2018brain, eide2021direction,
  eide2021impaired, eide2022altered}. These observations provide
distinct opportunities (and challenges) for personalized medicine
e.g.~for tailored intrathecal delivery of
chemotherapy~\cite{lohela2022glymphatic} and for early diagnostics of
impaired brain clearance~\cite{eide2021clinical, van2024human}. In
spite of their importance, our understanding of these mechanisms is
incomplete with open challenges and significant debate -- in part
relating to the transfer of knowledge between species, experimental
protocols, clinical cohorts, and individuals.

Perivascular pathways along the brain surface and within the brain
parenchyma have long been hypothesized to serve a designated role in
this context~\cite{rennels1985evidence, zhang1990interrelationships,
  ichimura1991distribution, carare2008solutes, iliff2012paravascular,
  foley2012realtime, hannocks2018molecular, van2024caa}. Recently, Eide and
Ringstad~\cite{eide2024functional} and Yamamoto et
al~\cite{yamamoto2024perivascular} demonstrated that perivascular
spaces (PVSs) define preferential pathways for molecular transport in
humans, with delayed periarterial enrichment in dementia
subtypes~\cite{eide2024functional}. Perivascular flow of cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) clearly contributes to this transport, and is inherently
associated with vascular pulsations~\cite{hadaczek2006perivascular,
  iliff2013cerebral, bedussi2018paravascular, mestre2018flow,
  boster2023artificial, hirschler2024region}. Fluid mechanics
considerations point at intracranial pressure differences and shorter
wavelength vascular wall pulsations as drivers of directional net flow
and convection in the PVS~\cite{bilston2003arterial, rey2018pulsatile,
  daversin2020mechanisms, kedarasetti2020functional,
  gjerde2023directional, nozaleda2024arterial}, while longer waves
such as the pulse wave primarily contribute to oscillatory flow and
dispersion~\cite{asgari2016glymphatic, sharp2019dispersion, thomas2019fluid,
  kedarasetti2020arterial, troyetsky2021dispersion, 
  martinac2021phase}. In the bigger picture, CSF is produced by the
choroid plexus~\cite{damkier2013cerebrospinal,
  steffensen2018cotransporter, liu2020direct}, pulsates through the
ventricular system, cisterns, and subarachnoid space (SAS) in
synchrony with cardiac, respiratory, and neural
waves~\cite{greitz1993pulsatile, wagshul2011pulsating,
  sweetman2011cerebrospinal, fultz2019coupled, vinje2019respiratory,
  eide2021direction, causemann2022human, williams2023neural,
  zimmermann2023total}, and drains via the dural sinuses, meningeal
lymphatics, cranial nerves, or other efflux
pathways~\cite{proulx2021cerebrospinal}. However, how these
physiological factors and physical mechanisms integrate to enhance (or
impair) human intracranial molecular transport over larger spatial
scales and longer time scales remain unknown. A related key question
is to what extent surface PVSs are separated from the SAS by
structural barriers~\cite{zhang1990interrelationships,
  weller2005microscopic, bedussi2017paravascular,
  pizzo2018intrathecal, mestre2022periarteriolar,
  mollgard2023mesothelium, smets2024perivascular, eide2024functional},
and in turn to what extent such structural compartmentalization is a
prerequisite for effective perivascular transport.
 
% What are our research questions and how do we answer them
In this study, by leveraging geometric model reduction and
mixed-dimensional modelling~\cite{masri2024modelling}, structural
magnetic resonance (MR) images~\cite{hodneland2019new}, and high
performance computing, we introduce an integrated computational model
of intracranial molecular enrichment and clearance. Focusing on the
interplay between perivascular pathways, pulsatility and CSF flow
dynamics, the model predicts the temporal evolution and spatial
distribution of a solute concentration with a detailed geometric
representation of the human SAS and ventricular system, networks of
surface PVSs and the brain
parenchyma. \draft{\lipsum[2]}

     \label{fig:results1}
\end{figure}
Using previously published multi-modal MRI
data~\cite{hodneland2019new, deistung2009tof,
  schweser2012quantitative, reichenbach2012future,
  deistung2017overview}, we construct a multiscale computational
representation of the human intracranial compartments consisting of
the CSF spaces and brain parenchyma as three-dimensional (3D) domains
and with the PVSs surrounding major surface arteries and veins as
embedded networks of topologically one-dimensional (1D) curves
(\Cref{fig:results1}A--C). We consider a solute concentration field,
varying in space and time, in the 3D domains and in the PVS networks,
and assume that the solute can cross between these compartments
through semi-permeable membranes. As the drivers and modes of
intracranial transport are under substantial
debate\cite{smith2019going, proulx2021cerebrospinal,
  bohr2022glymphatic, hladky2022glymphatic, betsholtz2024advances},
our first target is to establish a baseline model accounting for a
reasonably conservative set of mechanisms and their integrated effect
over a timescale of several minutes to a few days. To this end, we
assume that the solute will (i) diffuse within all compartments, with
diffusivity depending on the effective properties of the relevant
medium\cite{sykova2008diffusion}; (ii) experience significant
dispersive effects due to the pulsatile flow of CSF induced by the
cardiac and respiratory cycles\cite{vinje2019respiratory,
  keith2019dispersion, ray2021quantitative, troyetsky2021dispersion};
(iii) be convected by a (small) net flow of CSF resulting from CSF
production in the choroid plexus with CSF efflux across the upper
convexity\cite{hornkjol2022csf} and from the peristaltic pumping
effect of pulse wave pulsations in surface periarterial
spaces~\cite{mestre2018flow, gjerde2023directional}
(\Cref{fig:results1}D). Mathematically, this model is represented by a
mixed-dimensional system of coupled time-dependent partial
differential equations\cite{masri2024modelling}, which we solve
numerically with high accuracy using a mass-conserving finite element
scheme and the FEniCS finite element software\cite{alnaes2015fenics,
  kuchta2020assembly} (see Methods). The computational framework and
associated software are all openly available~\cite{ZENODO}.

Simulating a glymphatic MRI protocol~\cite{ringstad2017glymphatic,
  ringstad2018brain, eide2024functional}, we then predict the
spreading of $0.5$ mmol intrathecally injected Gadobutrol after its
appearance at the craniocervical junction
(\Cref{fig:results1}E--G). One hour post-injection, the in-silico
tracer moves upwards in the SAS frontally of the brainstem, and
quickly reaches the supratentorial regions. Here, it spreads both
posterior through the quadrigeminal cistern and the longitudinal
fissure, and anteriorly through the outer SAS, reaching the top of the
cerebral cortex after around 12 hours. After 24 hours, the tracer
covers most of the brain surface (with exception of some posterior
regions) and has penetrated several centimeters into the parenchymal
tissue. This pattern is reflected in the mean tracer concentrations in
each compartment, where the CSF space reaches its peak of
$1.4\,$mmol/l after 2 hours, followed by the arterial PVS
concentration peak ($2.9\,$mmol/l after 4 hours)
(\Cref{fig:results1}H). While the mean concentrations in these
compartments fall quickly soon after peaking, the parenchymal tissue
slowly enriches with tracer over the first 24 hours, with a final
value of $0.3$ mmol/l. Overall, about 40\% of the total amount of
tracer remains in the cranium 24 hours post-injection, with the largest
share in the CSF (53\%), followed by the parenchyma (35\%), the
venous PVS (8\%) and the arterial PVS
(5\%) (\Cref{fig:results1}I).

\end{figure}  

The enrichment patterns observed clinically after intrathecal
injection of Gadobutrol differ substantially between subjects and
between pathological conditions~\cite{ringstad2018brain,
  eide2021direction, eide2021impaired, eide2022altered}. These
neurological conditions are also associated with alterations in the
pulsatile flow of CSF in the ventricular system and
SAS~\cite{eide2021direction}. Clearly, key physiological factors such
as cardiac pulsatility and respiration easily differ between
individuals and between both pathological and physiological states. We
therefore next asked to what extent -- and how -- variations in CSF
pulsatility would affect the intracranial enrichment characteristics.

For the CSF dynamics in our baseline model, we combine the net
contribution to CSF flow induced by CSF production with the integrated
dispersive effects of cardiac and respiratory pulsatile CSF flow
(\Cref{fig:csf}A--C). Imposing a constant CSF production of
$400\,$ml/day across the surface of the lateral ventricles, while
allowing for efflux across the upper convexity, yields a total CSF
pressure drop of $26\,$mPa (0.00020 mmHg) (\Cref{fig:csf}D) with a
maximum flow velocity of $1.8\,$mm/s (in the aqueduct) and a mean
velocity in the SAS of $2.6\,\mu$m/s (\Cref{fig:csf}E). To examine the
dispersive effects of pulsatile CSF flow, we employ the theory of
shear-augmented dispersion together with computational fluid dynamics
to determine a dispersion factor $R$ enhancing the effective solute
diffusivity (see Methods). For the cardiac contribution, we compute
CSF pressure and flow fields at peak systolic blood inflow,
corresponding to a reduction in CSF space volume at a total rate of
$6\,$ml/s~\cite{baledent2014imaging, causemann2022human} in
  the SAS and $0.31\,$ml/s across the lateral ventricle
surface\cite{vinje2019respiratory}. This scenario sets up a pressure
drop of $10\,$Pa ($0.075$ mmHg) between the lateral ventricles and the
spinal SAS and a maximum flow velocity of $19.8\,$cm/s
(\Cref{fig:csf}F, J). Assuming a cardiac frequency of $1\,$Hz, we
infer that this cardiac-induced pulsatile CSF flow increases the
effective diffusion by more than two orders of magnitude in the
aqueduct and around the cisterna magna, but has little effect in most
of the SAS ($R < 1$) (\Cref{fig:csf}G, K). For the respiratory
contribution, we employ the same methodology, but with a total rate of
$1\,$ml/s \cite{gutierrez2022effect} in the SAS and
$0.121\,$ml/s \cite{liu2024using} in the lateral
  ventricles, yielding a respiratory peak flow volume of $1.121\,$
ml/s at the craniocervical junction. While
the resulting flow velocities are only about one fourth of their
cardiac-induced counterparts (see \Cref{fig:csf}H, L), respiratory
dispersive mixing reaches a factor of up to 350 due the lower
respiratory frequency of $0.25\,$Hz (\Cref{fig:csf}I, M).

Now, to examine how CSF pulsatility affects the enrichment patterns,
we consider three variations of the baseline: no CSF production,
reduced pulsatility and thus decreased dispersion ($0.1 \times R$) and
higher pulsatility with increased dispersion ($10 \times R$)
(\Cref{fig:csf}N). Without CSF production, transport is considerably
delayed. Even after $12$ hours, tracer remains in the subtentorial
regions around the cerebellum, the brain stem and in the surrounding
CSF. Interestingly, the lack of CSF production instead allows tracer
to travel upwards through the ventricular system, reaching the third
ventricle after around $12$ hours. On the other hand, if the CSF
pulsatility is reduced, we observe rapid transport towards the upper
convexity of the cranium, as in the baseline model, but the tracer
spreads exclusively within the anterior regions. This feature can be
attributed to the CSF flow bifurcation posterior to the
  ambient cistern (\Cref{fig:csf}D); without sufficient diffusion, the
  tracer is unable to cross into the posterior SAS. Indeed, with
higher dispersion, the tracer moves through the quadrigeminal cistern
and further upwards into the longitudinal fissure, with also
enrichment of the cerebellum.

\subsection*{Perivascular flow shapes and accelerates molecular enrichment}
\label{sec:pvs_flow_results}

The PVSs are recognized across species as critical pathways for solute
transport in and around the brain\cite{}, and thus as potential
targets for enhancing brain drug delivery and metabolic waste
clearance\cite{}. However, whether CSF flows more rapidly in PVSs and
what the forces and mechanisms required to drive such flow are, remain
as key points of debate~\cite{bohr2022glymphatic,
  van2024caa}. Motivated by experimental observations in animal
models~\cite{iliff2012paravascular, iliff2013cerebral, mestre2018flow,
  bedussi2018paravascular}, there is now a remarkable body of
literature on modelling perivascular fluid flow and
transport~\cite{bilston2003arterial, asgari2016glymphatic,
  rey2018pulsatile, daversin2020mechanisms, sharp2019dispersion,
  thomas2019fluid, kedarasetti2020functional, kedarasetti2020arterial,
  troyetsky2021dispersion, martinac2021phase, gjerde2023directional,
  nozaleda2024arterial}. Here, we ask how these proposed mechanisms
would translate from idealized geometries to human vascular networks
and moreover evaluate their integrated effect in the context of
intracranial solute transport.

Our periarterial network extends from the internal carotid arteries
and basilar artery through up to 18 bifurcations to reach upstream
network ends located within the SAS or up to 6 mm inside the
parenchyma (\Cref{fig:results1}A--C, \Cref{fig:pvs}A) and includes
major surface arteries of radius \discuss{0.5--1.4 mm}
(\Cref{fig:pvs}C). Imposing the pressure field induced by CSF
production at the periarterial network ends induces ultraslow CSF flow
of variable direction in these PVSs, with an average velocity of 0.08
$\mu$m/s (antegrade) and a maximum velocity of 0.55 $\mu$m/s
(\Cref{fig:pvs}D, H). On the other hand, traveling waves of arterial
wall motion (\Cref{fig:pvs}B), such as the pulse wave or other
vasomotion~\cite{vanveluw2020vasomotion, munting2023spontaneous,
  bojarskaite2023sleep, broggini2024long}, also induce net directional
flow in the PVS~\cite{kedarasetti2020arterial,
  kedarasetti2020functional, coenen2021lubrication,
  gjerde2023directional, nozaleda2024arterial} -- of magnitude and
direction depending on the amplitude, frequency, and length of the
waves and the characteristics of the perivascular
network~\cite{gjerde2023directional}. Applying a semi-analytic model
of the net flow induced by peristalsis in perivascular
networks~\cite{gjerde2023directional} (see Methods), we estimate that
the cardiac pulse wave alone, traveling at a frequency of 1 Hz with a
wavelength of 2.0 m and a 1\% wall displacement~\cite{jung2021novel},
will induce mainly antegrade PVS flow with an average net velocity of
0.92 $\mu$m/s while reaching up to 7.31 $\mu$m/s near larger, ventral
vessels such as the MCA (\Cref{fig:pvs}E, H). The same theory predicts
that strong ultraslow vasomotions, if traveling antegrade at 0.1Hz
with a wavelength of 0.02 m and a 10\%
displacement~\cite{broggini2024long}, will induce both retrograde and
antegrade net PVS flow with an average velocity of 13.05 $\mu$m/s and
maximum velocity $54.44$ $\mu$m/s (\Cref{fig:pvs}F, H).

We next study the effect of rapid PVS flow on intracranial molecular
enrichment by comparing the conservative baseline model and a higher
PVS flow model, where the former still includes the net flow
contributions from CSF production and the cardiac pulse wave, while
the latter additionally includes the ultraslow vasomotion
contribution. In both models, tracers were first observed at the basal
artery 48 minutes after injection (\Cref{fig:pvs}G), defined by their
first-time arrival (FTA), the time at which the concentration first
exceeds $0.1$ mmol/l. At all upstream locations along the middle
cerebral arteries (MCAs) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA), we found
substantially reduced FTAs with higher PVS flow (\Cref{fig:pvs}G,
N)\discuss{, up to 3 hours earlier in the M2 segment of the MCA}. Peak
concentrations in the PVS were attained earlier than in the
surrounding tissue (0:48h vs 1:12h at the MCA and 1:00h vs 1:48h at
MCA2) with higher PVS flow, while these peaks were nearly simultaneous
in the baseline. The earlier occurrence and delay in peak time between
the PVS and surrounding tissue clearly indicates the directionality of
tracer enrichment -- it first arrives in the PVS and subsequently
spreads into the tissue and SAS (\Cref{fig:pvs}L), and especially so with higher PVS
flow (\Cref{fig:pvs}M). These observations also hold on an aggregated level: computing
the total amount of tracer in the PVS as a function of the distance to
the arterial network roots, we find accelerated tracer transport with
higher PVS flow, especially at earlier time points (2--9 hours)
(\Cref{fig:pvs}I, K). Moreover, differences in tracer transport along
the PVS translate to altered enrichment patterns on the whole-organ
scale. For instance, after 4-6 hours, the faster-moving tracer in the
PVS is clearly visible in the adjacent spaces to the ACA, MCA, and
other arteries (\Cref{fig:pvs}O). In contrast, there are no clear
signs of early enrichment surrounding the PVS in the baseline model
(\Cref{fig:pvs}O).

A natural question is whether early PVS enrichment could be the result
of increased dispersion rather than net flow in the
PVS\cite{asgari2016glymphatic,keith2019dispersion,bojarskaite2023sleep,asgari2016glymphatic,troyetsky2021dispersion}. Interestingly, even increasing the dispersion factor by $100 \times$ in
the PVS only induced minor changes in the global spreading rate
compared to the baseline (\Cref{fig:pvs}J, O), thus indicating a
negative answer to this question.

%% We investigate the PVS flow velocities resulting from a transmantle pressure gradient, cardiac peristalsis and vasomotion-induced flow in a reconstructed arterial network and illustrate the effect of the obtained PVS flow fields on the spreading patterns of intrathecally injected tracer. Further, we explore whether solutes move exclusively from the PVS to the SAS, or bidirectionally along both pathways by comparison of first-time arrival times along major cerebral arteries.

%% To investigate PVS flow velocities, we extract the centerlines and associated radii of the arterial network from data \cite{hodneland2019new}, and label the main cerebral arteries (Figure 3A+C). We consider three different PVS flow fields: flow driven by CSF production-induced pressure differences, cardiac peristaltic flow, and vasomotion peristaltic flow (\Cref{fig:pvs}B). Pressure-driven flow velocities are computed by solving one-dimensional flow equations with pressure boundary conditions derived from the production field. Cardiac- and vasomotion-driven PVS flow velocities are obtained from semi-analytical estimates for peristaltic flow, assuming a frequency of 1\,Hz, a 1\,\% radius change, and a wavelength of 2 meters for cardiac flow, and a frequency of 0.1\,Hz, a 10\,\% radius change, and a wavelength of 2\,cm for vasomotion.

%% The production-driven pressure gradient induces low flow velocities, with an average velocity of 0.08\,\textmu m and a maximum velocity of 0.55\,\textmu m (\Cref{fig:csf}D+H). In contrast, cardiac-driven velocities are approximately one order of magnitude higher, with an average velocity of 0.92\,\textmu m and a maximum velocity of 7.31\,\textmu m (\Cref{fig:pvs}E+H). Vasomotion-driven PVS flow reach substantially higher velocities, up to 54\,\textmu m, with an average of 13.05\,\textmu m. For all drivers of PVS flow, the majority of flow occurred in the direction of blood flow, with only a small fraction in the opposing direction (\Cref{fig:pvs}H).

%\paragraph{Differences in PVS flow velocities substantially alter tracer enrichment patterns around major cerebral arteries}

%% Using the computed PVS flow velocities, we predict the effect of rapid PVS flow on intracranial transport by comparing a slow transport model (pressure-driven and cardiac-driven PVS flow) with a high-velocity model that accounts for all three mechanisms (pressure-, cardiac-, and vasomotion-driven). In both models, tracers were first observed 48 minutes after injection at the basal artery (\Cref{fig:pvs}G), defined by the first-time arrival (FTA), the time at which concentration first exceeds $0.1\,$mmol/l.

%% At all upstream locations along the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA), we found substantially reduced FTAs in the rapid PVS flow model (\Cref{fig:pvs}G+N). Furthermore, peak concentrations in the PVS were attained earlier than in the surrounding tissue (0:48h / 1:12h at the MCA and 1:00h / 1:48h at MCA2) in the vasomotion model, while concentrations peaked more simultaneously in the low-velocity model. The earlier occurrence and delay in peak time between the PVS and surrounding tissue indicate the directionality of tracer enrichment — it first arrives in the PVS and subsequently spreads into the tissue and SAS, especially in the vasomotion model.

%% The difference in tracer spreading observed at the MCA/ACA points also holds on an aggregated level in the whole arterial PVS. Computing the total amount of tracer in the PVS depending on the distance to the arterial network's inlet nodes (basal artery (BA), left internal carotid artery (ICA-L), or right internal carotid artery (ICA-R)), we find more rapid transport of tracer in the vasomotion model. We also investigate the potential effect of increased dispersion in the PVS, finding that adding a dispersion enhancement factor of 100 in the PVS only induced minor changes in the global spreading rate (\Cref{fig:pvs}J). However, differences in tracer transport along the PVS translate to altered enrichment patterns on a whole-organ scale. For instance, after 4-6 hours, the faster-moving tracer in the PVS is clearly visible in the adjacent spaces of the ACA, MCA, and other arteries in sagittal, coronal, and axial planes of the whole organ (\Cref{fig:pvs}O). In contrast, the model with only pressure- and cardiac-driven PVS flow does not exhibit clear signs of accelerated tracer transport along the PVS.

\subsection*{Structural versus functional compartmentalization of perivascular spaces}

Human and rodent observations indicate that tracers concentrate in perivascular spaces surrounding the pial and subarachnoid vasculature \cite{zhang1990interrelationships,zhang1992directional,eide2024functional, mestre2018flow}. However, it remains unclear whether such enrichment patterns necessitate a structural barrier, such as a semi-permeable membrane, or if they could result from enhanced flow or mixing (\Cref{fig:compartmentalization}A). Here, we investigate how the permeability of the interface between the PVS and surrounding CSF affects tracer enrichment around the major arterial trunks (\Cref{fig:compartmentalization}B).

Based on the high PVS velocity model from the previous section, we compare a high and low permeability model, corresponding to functional and structural compartmentalization, respectively. For the low permeability model, we set the permeability to $3.8 \cdot 10^{-7}\,$m/s, consistent with previous estimates for the endfoot sheath surrounding penetrating arterioles \cite{koch2023estimates}, which we consider a lower bound for the permeability between CSF and PVS. For the high permeability model, we increase the permeability by a factor of 100.
At the basal artery (BA), tracer appears after less than one hour in the CSF surrounding the BA in both models \Cref{fig:compartmentalization}C and E). In the high permeability model, tracer quickly crosses into the PVS, resulting in similar peak concentrations of 25\,mmol/l in the PVS and at its outer surface, while values up to 50\,mmol/l are attained in the vicinity. In contrast, the low permeability model exhibits substantially lower perivascular tracer enrichment, with a maximum concentration of 10\,mmol/l after approximately two hours.
%The high permeability model allows for more tracer crossing into the PVS, leading to higher concentrations further downstream. Notably, crossover into the parenchyma is also observed, most clearly at 4 hours.
For the middle cerebral arteries (MCA-R and MCA-L), tracer appears first in the PVS in both models, with higher concentrations in the high permeability model (up to 24/21 mmol/l (R/L) peak concentration). In the high permeability model, tracer leaks out of the PVS and spreads in the Sylvian fissure. With a small delay (see \Cref{fig:compartmentalization}F for peak time difference), more tracer appears via the CSF pathway.

At the anterior cerebral artery (ACA-2), the first tracer arrival in the PVS occurs after 3 hours, with a peak at 5 hours. The peak in the PVS is followed shortly by a higher peak in the CSF, indicating tracer arrival through a second pathway, i.e., through the CSF-filled space outside of the PVS. Similar patterns are observed for ACA-A3.

Summarizing and quantifying these observations (\Cref{fig:compartmentalization}F), we find that both first-time arrival and peak time are not substantially affected by the PVS-CSF permeability, while the concentration difference between the PVS and its surrounding CSF quickly decreases with higher permeability, as does the time lag between the peaks in these domains. 
This indicates that fast transport along the PVS might not hinge upon a structural compartmentalization of the PVS, whereas a sharp concentration gradient between PVS and CSF is unlikely without a restricting barrier.

\section*{Discussion}


\subsection*{Summary of findings}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Presented a holistic and integrated in-silico model of molecular
  enrichment in human intracranial spaces allowing for individualized
  predictions of molecular enrichment in human intracranial spaces and
  how physiological pulsations such as variations in respiration or
  cardiac pulsatility or pathological conditions such as enlarged
  perivascular spaces.
\item
  A key observation is that the balance between CSF production and
  intracranial pulsatility strongly shapes the large scale features of
  molecular enrichment patterns: this well-explains the large
  individual variations in enrichment observed
  clinically~\cite{ringstad2018brain}.
\item
  Even slow (0.1--1.0 $\mu$m/s) mean CSF flow in the surface PVS gives
  earlier tracer enrichment around the major cerebral arteries, but
  the effect is more pronounced with up 3 hours difference in time of
  arrival with higher PVS flow of the order 10 $\mu$m/s.
\item
  Rigorously-derived models of PVS flow in perivascular networks based
  on first-principles naturally yield both retrograde and antegrade
  flow, both in the presence of pressure differences at the network
  ends, but also in the absence of such a pressure difference. 
\item
  The PVS may function as highways, facilitating rapid transport, even
  without the presence of structural barriers; but a sharp
  concentration difference between the PVS and surroundings is
  unlikely without it.

The large discrepancies in reported estimates can (at least partly) be attributed to different assumptions on representative values for local width, pressure differences and fluid velocities in the SAS, which reflect the diverse flow characteristics in the different regions of the intracranial CSF-filled space.}

\paragraph{CSF flow model validation}

Hornkjøl et al \cite{hornkjol2022csf} model CSF flow induced by production in the choroid plexus and report a peak velocity of $8.9\,$mm/s in the aqueduct. Given that similar flow rates were enforced, the deviation from our value of $2.0\,$mm/s is likely due to differences in diameter of the reconstructed aqueduct. Additionally, their peak velocities in the SAS range between 20 - 50 $\mu\,$m/s, which is compatible with our mean velocity of $4.4\,\mu$m/s (\Cref{fig:csf_flow_histo}).

The aqueductal ($0.31\,$ml/s) and craniocervical ($8.31\,$ml/s) flow rates predicted by our model align well with previously reported values of $0.31\,$ml/s peak aqueductal flow rate \cite{vinje2019respiratory} and about $9\,$ml/s peak net blood inflow into the cranium \cite{baledent2014imaging}. Further, Linninger et al \cite{linninger2007cerebrospinal} model cardiac-induced CSF flow and predict a maximum transmantle pressure difference of $10\,$Pa, which is in good agreement with our estimate of $8.5\,$Pa as well as clinically measured mean pressure differences of $11.5\,$Pa between sensors placed subdurally and in the lateral ventricle \cite{vinje2019respiratory}.
% 10.7 cm/s CSF flow at the craniovertebral junction in control \cite{bapuraj2016cerebrospinal}, area difference?

Sharp et al used the theory of dispersive mixing to predict a dispersion enhancement factor of $91.8$ in the (open) spinal SAS, which lies well within the range of our spatially varying estimate (ranging from 0 to 160). Conversely, \cite{ray2021quantitative} report up to 10,000 times greater diffusion in perivascular regions, but their modelling lumps diffusive, dispersive and advective transport in a single enhancement factor and is thus not directly comparable.

The absolute and relative roles of different transport mechanisms in
the parenchyma is more controversial: diffusion clearly plays a role
\cite{nicolson}, the low permeability of the extracellular space
hinders significant convection neuropil \cite{holter}, (estimates on
the order of 1-10 $\mu$/min) in humans \cite{vinje2023human} and cats
\cite{cserr}, possibly focused on perivascular spaces along
penetrating vessel.

\subsection*{Limitations}

In terms of limitations, we here simulate the intracranial
distribution of a tracer concentration appearing at the craniocervical
junction rather than as an intrathecal injection. We therefore
overestimate the amount of tracer entering into the intracranial
spaces; however, due to the linearity of the mathematical model, it is
valid to directly interpret the in-silico concentrations relative to
the total amount of tracer.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Not all of the injected tracer get to the craniocervical
  junction. What is the impact of this. Linear effect, just scale the
  our predicted values e.g.~in \Cref{fig:results1}.
\item 
  Inaccuracies in vascular geometry representation - and consequences
  downstream for e.g. numerical integration. PVS geometry assumptions
  and approximations. Humans different from mice. Limitations in
  resolution. No vasculature in the cerebellum, and of course no
  vasculature below certain resolution.
\item
  Very simplified model of transport in the parenchyma, no PVS there,
  no glymphatics there. Clearly have an effect on the later stage
  transport in the brain, though the current model provides a baseline
  for comparison, accounting for isotropic diffusion alone.
  Accounting for brain diffusive anisotropy. Little effect
  expected. Maybe something to consider in small follow-up
  work. Interestingly, blobs match observations of large molecular
  tracer observations.
\item
  Assumed no transport across the BBB. PVS-blood exchange and BBB
  leakage. Natural to consider in model variation here, or follow-up
  work. We here ignore PVS-blood exchange, and thus only model the
  perivascular concentration at the network level (in addition to the
  SAS/brain concentration in the surroundings).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Intracranial compartments: ventricular system, SAS, and brain parenchyma}

From T1-weighted MR images of a human subject~\cite{hodneland2019new},
we first automatically segment the brain parenchyma and CSF spaces,
including the ventricular system and SAS, using
Synthseg~\cite{billot2023robust,billot2023synthseg}
(\Cref{fig:results1}A--B). We next manually adjust the segmentation to
accurately represent the connections between CSF spaces (aqueduct,
median aperture, tentorium cerebelli), smoothen, and finally extract
surface representations of the outer (arachnoid) boundary, the pial
membrane and other interfaces. Conforming to these surface and
interface representations, we generate a tetrahedral mesh $\Omega$
representing the complete intracranial volume as the union of the
parenchyma $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ and CSF spaces $\Omega_{\rm CSF}$, using
fTetWild~\cite{hu2020fast} (\Cref{fig:csf}A--B). The resulting
computational mesh consists of $221\,988$ vertices and $1\,225\,774$
mesh cells, which vary between $0.24$ mm and $1.29$ cm in mesh cell
diameter. The parenchyma has a total volume of $1318$ ml, whereas the
ventricles and the outer SAS contribute $32$ ml and $328$ ml,
respectively, to a total CSF volume of $360$ml, in agreement with
recent estimates~\cite{hladky2024regulation}.

%% In addition, we slightly modify the segmentation to ensure correct
%% connectivity of the ventricular system. In particular, we elongate
%% the aqueduct and enforce no communication between the ventricles
%% and the surrounding CSF spaces except for the median aperture.
%% After morphological smoothing of the segmented image, we extract
%% surface representations of the outer SAS boundary, the pial
%% membrane and the components of the ventricular system.

%% Note that the widely reported value of $150$\,ml of intracranial
%% CSF volume is likely an underestimate. Recent estimates indicate
%% that a value of $200$ to $300$\,ml is more accurate (see
%% \cite{hladky2024regulation} and references therein

\subsection*{Periarterial and perivenous spaces}

To represent surface networks of periarterial and perivenous spaces,
we use Kiminaro~\cite{william_silversmith_2021_5539913} to separately
skeletonize time-of-flight angiography (ToF) and quantitative
susceptibility mapping (QSM) images from the same human
subject~\cite{hodneland2019new}. This technique yields networks of
one-dimensional curves, each curve $\Lambda^i$ indicating the
centerline of a blood vessel segment and labeled with its lumen radius
$R_1^i$ (\Cref{fig:results1}C, \Cref{fig:pvs}A). We also assign an
outer radius $R_2^i > R_1^i$ to each segment $i$, form the annular
cylinder ensheathing $\Lambda^i$ and define the union of these as the
PVS. The periarterial network graph consists of $12\,708$ edges
connected at $12\,562$ inner nodes and with $147$ end nodes, and the
associated domain is denoted by $\Lambda_a$. We identify three of the
end nodes -- corresponding to the two internal carotid arteries (ICAs)
and the basilar artery (BA) -- as root nodes, and designate the other
ends as leaf nodes. The resulting perivenous network graph consists of
$\fixme{N}$ edges connected at $\fixme{N}$ inner nodes and with
$\fixme{N}$ end nodes, and the associated domain is denoted by
$\Lambda_v$. \discuss{Finally, we label the outer surface of the PVSs
  associated with $\Lambda_a$ and $\Lambda_v$, by $\Gamma_a$ and
  $\Gamma_v$ respectively.}

%% The resulting vascular networks are further smoothened using a
%% spline interpolation technique, and represented as graphs with
%% nodes connected by edges.

\subsection*{Molecular transport equations}

We model diffusion, convection, and exchange of a molecular solute in
the PVS networks $\Lambda_a$ and $\Lambda_v$, in the CSF spaces
$\Omega_{\rm CSF}$ and in the brain parenchyma $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ via
a mixed-dimensional transport model~\cite{masri2023modelling} over a
timescale of minutes to hours (\Cref{fig:results1}A--C,
\Cref{fig:csf}A--C). Specifically, for $t > 0$, we solve for a
concentration $c = c(x, t)$ in the 3D intracranial compartments ($x
\in \Omega_{\rm CSF}, x \in \Omega_{\rm PAR}$) and for a cross-section
averaged concentration $\hat{c} = \hat{c}(s, t)$ in the periarterial
and perivenous networks ($s \in \Lambda_a, s \in \Lambda_v$) such that
the following equations hold:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
  \partial_t (\phi c) - \nabla \cdot (D \nabla (\phi c) ) + \nabla \cdot (\bm u c ) + \xi (\overline{c} - \hat c ) \delta_\Gamma & = 0 && \quad \quad \mathrm{in} \quad \Omega_{\rm CSF}, \Omega_{\rm{PAR}},
  \label{eq:multi_transport_3d}
  \\ 
  \partial_t (A  \hat c) - \partial_s(\hat D A \partial_s ( \hat c)) +\partial_s(A \hat u \hat c )  +  \xi P (\hat c - \overline{c})  &= 0 && \quad \quad \mathrm{in} \quad  \Lambda_a, \Lambda_v .
  \label{eq:multi_transport_1d}
 \end{alignat}%
\label{eq:multi_transport}%
\end{subequations}%
In~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}, $0 < \phi \leqslant 1$ is the fluid
volume fraction, $D$ and $\hat{D}$ are effective diffusion
coefficients, and $\bm u$ and $\hat{u}$ are fluid (CSF/ISF)
velocities, all defined in the respective compartments; $P = 2 \pi
R_2$ is the perimeter and $A = \pi (R_2^2 - R_1^2)$ the area of the
PVS cross-sections, $\delta_{\Gamma}$ is a Dirac term concentrated on
the interfaces $\Gamma_a, \Gamma_v$, the overlined $\overline{c}$
denotes the average of $c$ over cross-sections of $\Gamma_a,
\Gamma_v$, and $\xi$ is a permeability allowing for transfer/exchange
over the interfaces $\Gamma_a, \Gamma_v$ between the periarterial and
perivenous networks and their surroundings.  Moreover, we model the
membrane between the parenchyma and the CSF spaces as a semi-permeable
membrane with permeability coefficient $\beta_{\rm pia}$. For a
complete description of this mathematical model and simulation
scenarios, see \Cref{sec:app:more_maths}. The initial concentrations
in the three-dimensional domain $\Omega$ and networks $\Lambda_a,
\Lambda_v$ are all set to zero.

\subsection*{Intracranial influx after intrathecal injection}
To represent molecular influx into the intracranial compartments
following intrathecal injection, without modelling the spinal
compartment explicitly, we prescribe a time-dependent molecular influx
over the interface towards the spinal CSF compartment with the condition
\begin{equation*}
  (D \nabla c - \bm u c ) \cdot \bm{n} = g_{\mathrm{influx}},  \quad \mathrm{on}  \quad \Gamma_{\mathrm{SSAS}}.
\end{equation*}
Here we set
\begin{equation*}
  g_\mathrm{influx}(t) = \frac{m_{\rm tot}}{T_{\rm max}^2 |\Gamma_{\rm SSAS}|} \max(0, T_{\rm max} - |t - T_{\rm max}|), 
\end{equation*}
which expresses a hat-shaped influx function with a peak at $T_{\rm max}$ and a total tracer injection of $m_{\rm tot}$ (\Cref{tab:parameters}).

\subsection*{Molecular clearance from the intracranial space and perivascular network ends}

We model molecular clearance, into the meningeal lymphatics or other
pathways, across the upper, outer (arachnoid) boundary
(\Cref{fig:results1}A, \Cref{fig:csf}C), proportional to the
concentration in the SAS with a rate constant $\beta_{\rm exit}$. We
set a no-flux condition at the end nodes of the perivascular networks,
not allowing for direct molecular clearance there.

\subsection*{CSF flow in the SAS and ventricular system}
%\label{sec:csf_fluid_vel}

We model CSF as an incompressible Newtonian fluid at low Reynolds and
Womersley numbers via the Stokes equations with viscosity $\mu$, and
account for the convective contribution of the flow induced by CSF
production in the choroid plexus. Specifically, we compute the
velocity $\bm u_{\rm CSF}$ and associated pressure $p_{\rm CSF}$ in
the SAS and ventricular system induced by a constant production at a
rate of $u_{\rm in}$ across the lateral ventricle walls and with
efflux across the upper, outer (arachnoid) boundary with efflux
resistance $R_0$; and then set $\bm u = \bm u_{\rm CSF}$ in
$\Omega_{\rm CSF}$ in~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}
(\Cref{tab:parameters}, \Cref{fig:csf}A--E, see also
\Cref{sec:app:more_maths}). We do not model bulk flow within the brain
parenchyma, except within the perivascular network segments extending
below the pial surface, and thus set $\bm u = 0$ in $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$
in~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}.

\subsection*{Dispersion in the CSF spaces}
%\label{sec:csf_dispersion}
%% MER: I'm commenting out labels as long as there is no numbering

The pulsatile flow of CSF in the SAS and ventricular system,
associated with the cardiac and respiratory cycles, substantially
enhances molecular diffusion through
dispersion~\cite{taylor1953dispersion, watson1983diffusion,
  asgari2016glymphatic, keith2019dispersion, ray2021quantitative,
  troyetsky2021dispersion}. To account for these dispersive effects,
while bridging from the pulsatile flow time scale of seconds to a
molecular transport time scale of hours, we compute cardiac and
respiratory dispersion factors $R_c$ and $R_r$, both
spatially-varying, in $\Omega_{\rm CSF}$ (\Cref{fig:csf}A) by
combining computational estimates of the respective peak CSF pressure
gradients with theoretical estimates for shear-augmented (Taylor)
dispersion \cite{taylor1953dispersion, watson1983diffusion,
  keith2019dispersion} (see \Cref{sec:app:dispersion} for a complete
description). Combining these effects, we then set $R = R_c + R_r$ and
define the effective diffusion coefficient $D = (1 + R) D^{\rm Gad}$
in $\Omega_{\rm CSF}$ in~\eqref{eq:multi_transport} in the baseline model.

\subsection*{Perivascular fluid flow induced by CSF pressure differences}

To estimate the contribution also to perivascular fluid flow from CSF
production, we impose the fluid pressure $p_{\rm CSF}$ induced by CSF
production, computed in the SAS and ventricular system, at the end
nodes of the periarterial network located within the SAS. For the
network end nodes located within the parenchyma, we compute a harmonic
extension of the CSF pressure field (by solving a Laplace equation in
$\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ with $p_{\rm CSF}$ as the boundary value), and set
the corresponding value at these end nodes. We then numerically solve
a system of hydraulic network equations to compute $\hat{u}^p_a$
defined over $\Lambda_a$; i.e., the pressure-difference induced CSF
flow velocity in the periarterial network (see
also~\Cref{sec:app:hydraulic_network}). We repeat this procedure to
compute a corresponding velocity $\hat{u}^p_v$ in the perivenous
network $\Lambda_v$.

%% \subsection*{Dispersion in the PVS}

%% Similar to the CSF spaces, dispersion due to cardiac and respiratory pulsation has been hypothesized to enhance transport in the perivascular spaces. However, recent estimates indicate that the effect of dispersion does not exceed a factor of 2 compared to diffusion alone \cite{asgari2016glymphatic,keith2019dispersion,bojarskaite2023sleep,asgari2016glymphatic,troyetsky2021dispersion}.

% \cite{keith2019dispersion}: dispersion in PVS is negligiable in porous PVS, but might be relevant in open PVS (R=220) (theoretical estimates)
%  \cite{bojarskaite2023sleep} numerical simulations show that the enhancement factor is likely in the range of 10 - 50 \%
%\cite{asgari2016glymphatic} numerical simulations show increase of 16% to 50%  in distribution lengths
%\cite{troyetsky2021dispersion}:   maximum enhancement of diffusion of only about 5%

\subsection*{Perivascular fluid flow induced by arterial wall motion}

Using the theoretical framework introduced by Gjerde et
al.~\cite{gjerde2023directional}, we also compute analytic estimates
for the time-average perivascular flow rate $\langle Q' \rangle$
induced by peristalsis in the arterial network $\Lambda_a$; i.e.~the
net flow induced by travelling waves of arterial wall motion of
frequency $f$, amplitude $\varepsilon$ and wave lengths $\lambda$
(\Cref{fig:pvs}D). The corresponding contribution to the periarterial
flow velocity is defined for each segment $\Lambda_i$ as $\langle Q'_i
\rangle/A_i$ where $A_i = \pi (R_2^i - R_1^i)$ is the cross-section
area of the PVS segment and $\langle Q_i' \rangle$ is the estimated
mean flow rate (see Supplementary Methods~\ref{sec:app:peristalsis}
for more details). Two wall motion patterns are considered, yielding
$\hat{u}_a^c$ and $\hat{u}_a^v$ respectively: \emph{cardiac}
pulsations with $f = 1.0$Hz, $\lambda = 2$ m and $\varepsilon = 1\%$
(\Cref{fig:pvs}E), and very low-frequency \emph{vasomotion} with $f =
0.1$Hz, $\lambda = 0.02$m, and $\varepsilon = 10\%$
(\Cref{fig:pvs}F). No flow induced by peristalsis is considered for
the perivenous network. In the baseline model, we combine the
contributions from CSF production and cardiac peristalsis to set
$\hat{u}$ in~\eqref{eq:multi_transport} as $\hat{u}_a = \hat{u}_a^p +
\hat{u}_a^c$ in $\Lambda_a$, and $\hat{u}_v = \hat{u}_v^p$ in
$\Lambda_v$.



\subsection*{Model and material parameters}

Model and material parameters are summarized in \Cref{tab:parameters},
and~\Cref{tab:scenarios} gives an overview of the different in-silico
scenarios. We assume that the porosity equals the extracellular space
volume fraction $\phi = \phi_{\rm PAR}$ within the parenchyma and
$\phi = 1$ elsewhere. The effective diffusion coefficient is set equal
to that of Gadubutrol in free water in the PVS networks: $\hat{D} =
D^{\rm Gad}$; weighted by a dispersion factor $R$ in the CSF spaces:
$D|_{\Omega_{\rm CSF}} = ( 1 + R) D^{\rm Gad}$; and modulated by the
porosity and tortuosity ($\lambda = 1.78$) in the parenchyma:
$D|_{\Omega_{\rm PAR}} = D^{\rm Gad}_{\rm PAR}$. We set $\xi$
depending on whether the PVS segment is fully embedded within the CSF
spaces ($\xi = \xi_{\rm CSF}$) or parenchyma ($\xi = \xi_{\rm EF}$),
or neither (\Cref{sec:app:more_maths}). Additionally, we increase the
permeability $\xi$ ($100\times$) \fixme{near} the leaf nodes of
$\Lambda_a$ to account for the transition from explicitly resolved
PVSs to their unresolved continuation in the CSF spaces and
parenchyma.

\subsection*{Numerical approximation, implementation, and  verification}

A complete description of the numerical methods used is provided in
\Cref{sec:details_numerical_method}, while a condensed summary is
given here. To solve~\eqref{eq:multi_transport} numerically, we use
the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with weighted
averages and upwinding for the convection term in the 3D
domains~\cite{ern2009discontinuous} -- to ensure numerical stability
and minimize the artificial presence of negative concentation
values. For the 1D domain, we use continuous finite element spaces
defined over each of the networks and stabilized with numerical
diffusion when $\hat{u}$ is non--zero. Note that the 3D--1D coupling
in~\eqref{eq:multi_transport} induces a singularity in the solution
$c$ and one can only expect lower-order error convergence near
$\Lambda_a$ and $\Lambda_v$. Away from these 1D networks, almost
optimal approximation is expected~\cite{masri2023discontinuous,
  koppl2016local}. To numerically solve the Stokes equations to
compute the CSF flow velocity and pressure in the ventricular system
and SAS, we use finite element spaces that preserve the
incompressibility condition on the discrete
level~\cite{hong2016robust}. This requirement is important for
numerical stability when later
solving~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}\cite{cesmelioglu2022compatible}. The
spaces we used for the velocity are continuous along the normal
direction; continuity of the tangential component is enforced via
interior penalty approaches~\cite{hong2016robust}. Optimal
approximation properties are expected for this scheme. These numerical
methods were implemented using the FEniCS finite element
framework~\cite{alnaes2015fenics}, and the 3D-1D coupling is handled
by the extension
FEniCS\textsubscript{ii}~\cite{kuchta2020assembly}. The correctness
and accuracy of the numerical solutions were verified by a series of
numerical verification experiments \fixme{(see \Cref{sec:app:verification})}.

%% The choice this scheme was is necessary here since continuous Galerkin
%% methods even when supplemented with artificial diffusion stabilization
%% terms were unstable in our experiments.
