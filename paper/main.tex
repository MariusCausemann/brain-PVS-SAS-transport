\section*{Introduction}

% What is the big picture problem and why is it important? 
The mechanisms underlying molecular transport within the intracranial
space are fundamental to human brain health and
function. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease are all associated with
abnormal accumulation of protein aggregates together with alterations
in transport and clearance
characteristics~\cite{rasmussen2018glymphatic, harrison2020impaired,
  eide2023plasma, liu2024glymphatic}. Moreover, sleep and conversely
sleep-deprivation play a definite yet enigmatic role in modulating
molecular enrichment and clearance~\cite{xie2013sleep, eide2021sleep,
  eide2022altered, miao2024brain}. In the last decade, established
theories have been challenged by new findings revealing a greater
degree of molecular movement and exchange~\cite{iliff2012paravascular,
  ringstad2017glymphatic, louveau2017understanding,
  proulx2021cerebrospinal, bohr2022glymphatic}, as well as substantial
variability in enrichment and clearance between individuals and
between patient cohorts~\cite{ringstad2018brain, eide2021direction,
  eide2021impaired, eide2022altered}. These observations provide
distinct opportunities (and challenges) for personalized medicine
e.g.~for tailored intrathecal delivery of
chemotherapy~\cite{lohela2022glymphatic} and for early diagnostics of
impaired brain clearance~\cite{eide2021clinical, van2024human}. In
spite of their importance, our understanding of these mechanisms is
incomplete with open challenges and significant debate -- in part
relating to the transfer of knowledge between species, experimental
protocols, clinical cohorts, and individuals.

Perivascular pathways along the brain surface and within the brain
parenchyma have long been hypothesized to serve a designated role in
this context~\cite{rennels1985evidence, zhang1990interrelationships,
  ichimura1991distribution, carare2008solutes, iliff2012paravascular,
  foley2012realtime, hannocks2018molecular, van2024caa}. Recently, Eide and
Ringstad~\cite{eide2024functional} and Yamamoto et
al~\cite{yamamoto2024perivascular} demonstrated that perivascular
spaces (PVSs) define preferential pathways for molecular transport in
humans, with delayed periarterial enrichment in dementia
subtypes~\cite{eide2024functional}. Perivascular flow of cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) clearly contributes to this transport, and is inherently
associated with vascular pulsations~\cite{hadaczek2006perivascular,
  iliff2013cerebral, bedussi2018paravascular, mestre2018flow,
  boster2023artificial, hirschler2024region}. Fluid mechanics
considerations point at intracranial pressure differences and shorter
wavelength vascular wall pulsations as drivers of directional net flow
and convection in the PVS~\cite{bilston2003arterial, rey2018pulsatile,
  daversin2020mechanisms, kedarasetti2020functional,
  gjerde2023directional, nozaleda2024arterial}, while longer waves
such as the pulse wave primarily contribute to oscillatory flow and
dispersion~\cite{asgari2016glymphatic, sharp2019dispersion, thomas2019fluid,
  kedarasetti2020arterial, troyetsky2021dispersion, 
  martinac2021phase}. In the bigger picture, CSF is produced by the
choroid plexus~\cite{damkier2013cerebrospinal,
  steffensen2018cotransporter, liu2020direct}, pulsates through the
ventricular system, cisterns, and subarachnoid space (SAS) in
synchrony with cardiac, respiratory, and neural
waves~\cite{greitz1993pulsatile, wagshul2011pulsating,
  sweetman2011cerebrospinal, fultz2019coupled, vinje2019respiratory,
  eide2021direction, causemann2022human, williams2023neural,
  zimmermann2023total}, and drains via the dural sinuses, meningeal
lymphatics, cranial nerves, or other efflux
pathways~\cite{proulx2021cerebrospinal}. However, how these
physiological factors and physical mechanisms integrate to enhance (or
impair) human intracranial molecular transport over larger spatial
scales and longer time scales remain unknown. A related key question
is to what extent surface PVSs are separated from the SAS by
structural barriers~\cite{zhang1990interrelationships,
  weller2005microscopic, bedussi2017paravascular,
  pizzo2018intrathecal, mestre2022periarteriolar,
  mollgard2023mesothelium, smets2024perivascular, eide2024functional},
and in turn to what extent such structural compartmentalization is a
prerequisite for effective perivascular transport.
 
% What are our research questions and how do we answer them
In this study, by leveraging geometric model reduction and
mixed-dimensional modelling~\cite{masri2024modelling}, structural
magnetic resonance (MR) images~\cite{hodneland2019new}, and high
performance computing, we introduce an integrated computational model
of intracranial molecular enrichment and clearance. Focusing on the
interplay between perivascular pathways, pulsatility and CSF flow
dynamics, the model predicts the temporal evolution and spatial
distribution of a solute concentration with a detailed geometric
representation of the human SAS and ventricular system, networks of
surface PVSs and the brain
parenchyma. \textcolor{lightgray}{\lipsum[2]}

     \label{fig:results1}
\end{figure}
Using previously published multi-modal MRI
data~\cite{hodneland2019new, deistung2009tof,
  schweser2012quantitative, reichenbach2012future,
  deistung2017overview}, we construct a multiscale computational
representation of the human intracranial compartments consisting of
the CSF spaces and brain parenchyma as three-dimensional (3D) domains
and with the PVSs surrounding major surface arteries and veins as
embedded networks of topologically one-dimensional (1D) curves
(\Cref{fig:results1}A--C). We consider a solute concentration field,
varying in space and time, in the 3D domains and in the PVS networks,
and assume that the solute can cross between these compartments
through semi-permeable membranes. As the drivers and modes of
intracranial transport are under substantial
debate\cite{smith2019going, proulx2021cerebrospinal,
  bohr2022glymphatic, hladky2022glymphatic, betsholtz2024advances},
our first target is to establish a baseline model accounting for a
reasonably conservative set of mechanisms and their integrated effect
over a timescale of several minutes to a few days. To this end, we
assume that the solute will (i) diffuse within all compartments, with
diffusivity depending on the effective properties of the relevant
medium\cite{sykova2008diffusion}; (ii) experience significant
dispersive effects due to the pulsatile flow of CSF induced by the
cardiac and respiratory cycles\cite{vinje2019respiratory,
  keith2019dispersion, ray2021quantitative, troyetsky2021dispersion};
(iii) be convected by a (small) net flow of CSF resulting from CSF
production in the choroid plexus with CSF efflux across the upper
convexity\cite{hornkjol2022csf} and from the peristaltic pumping
effect of pulse wave pulsations in surface periarterial
spaces~\cite{mestre2018flow, gjerde2023directional}
(\Cref{fig:results1}D). Mathematically, this model is represented by a
mixed-dimensional system of coupled time-dependent partial
differential equations\cite{masri2024modelling}, which we solve
numerically with high accuracy using a mass-conserving finite element
scheme and the FEniCS finite element software\cite{alnaes2015fenics,
  kuchta2020assembly} (see Methods). The computational framework and
associated software are all openly available~\cite{ZENODO}.

Simulating a glymphatic MRI protocol~\cite{ringstad2017glymphatic,
  ringstad2018brain, eide2024functional}, we then predict the
spreading of $0.5$ mmol intrathecally injected Gadobutrol after its
appearance at the craniocervical junction
(\Cref{fig:results1}E--G). One hour post-injection, the in-silico
tracer moves upwards in the SAS frontally of the brainstem, and
quickly reaches the supratentorial regions. Here, it spreads both
posterior through the quadrigeminal cistern and the longitudinal
fissure, and anteriorly through the outer SAS, reaching the top of the
cerebral cortex after around 12 hours. After 24 hours, the tracer
covers most of the brain surface (with exception of some posterior
regions) and has penetrated several centimeters into the parenchymal
tissue. This pattern is reflected in the mean tracer concentrations in
each compartment, where the CSF space reaches its peak of
$1.4\,$mmol/l after 2 hours, followed by the arterial PVS
concentration peak ($2.9\,$mmol/l after 4 hours)
(\Cref{fig:results1}H). While the mean concentrations in these
compartments fall quickly soon after peaking, the parenchymal tissue
slowly enriches with tracer over the first 24 hours, with a final
value of $0.3$ mmol/l. Overall, about 40\% of the total amount of
tracer remains in the cranium 24 hours post-injection, with the largest
share in the CSF (53\%), followed by the parenchyma (35\%), the
venous PVS (8\%) and the arterial PVS
(5\%) (\Cref{fig:results1}I).

\end{figure}  

The enrichment patterns observed clinically after intrathecal
injection of Gadobutrol differ substantially between subjects and
between pathological conditions~\cite{ringstad2018brain,
  eide2021direction, eide2021impaired, eide2022altered}. These
neurological conditions are also associated with alterations in the
pulsatile flow of CSF in the ventricular system and
SAS~\cite{eide2021direction}. Clearly, key physiological factors such
as cardiac pulsatility and respiration easily differ between
individuals and between both pathological and physiological states. We
therefore next asked to what extent -- and how -- variations in CSF
pulsatility would affect the intracranial enrichment characteristics.

For the CSF dynamics in our baseline model, we combine the net
contribution to CSF flow induced by CSF production with the integrated
dispersive effects of cardiac and respiratory pulsatile CSF flow
(\Cref{fig:csf}A--C). Imposing a constant CSF production of
$400\,$ml/day across the surface of the lateral ventricles, while
allowing for efflux across the upper convexity, yields a total CSF
pressure drop of $26\,$mPa (0.00020 mmHg) (\Cref{fig:csf}D) with a
maximum flow velocity of $1.8\,$mm/s (in the aqueduct) and a mean
velocity in the SAS of $2.6\,\mu$m/s (\Cref{fig:csf}E). To examine the
dispersive effects of pulsatile CSF flow, we employ the theory of
shear-augmented dispersion together with computational fluid dynamics
to determine a dispersion factor $R$ enhancing the effective solute
diffusivity (see Methods). For the cardiac contribution, we compute
CSF pressure and flow fields at peak systolic blood inflow,
corresponding to a reduction in CSF space volume at a total rate of
$6\,$ml/s~\cite{baledent2014imaging, causemann2022human} in
  the SAS and $0.31\,$ml/s across the lateral ventricle
surface\cite{vinje2019respiratory}. This scenario sets up a pressure
drop of $10\,$Pa ($0.075$ mmHg) between the lateral ventricles and the
spinal SAS and a maximum flow velocity of $19.8\,$cm/s
(\Cref{fig:csf}F, J). Assuming a cardiac frequency of $1\,$Hz, we
infer that this cardiac-induced pulsatile CSF flow increases the
effective diffusion by more than two orders of magnitude in the
aqueduct and around the cisterna magna, but has little effect in most
of the SAS ($R < 1$) (\Cref{fig:csf}G, K). For the respiratory
contribution, we employ the same methodology, but with a total rate of
$1\,$ml/s \cite{gutierrez2022effect} in the SAS and
$0.121\,$ml/s \cite{liu2024using} in the lateral
  ventricles, yielding a respiratory peak flow volume of $1.121\,$
ml/s at the craniocervical junction. While
the resulting flow velocities are only about one fourth of their
cardiac-induced counterparts (see \Cref{fig:csf}H, L), respiratory
dispersive mixing reaches a factor of up to 350 due the lower
respiratory frequency of $0.25\,$Hz (\Cref{fig:csf}I, M).

Now, to examine how CSF pulsatility affects the enrichment patterns,
we consider three variations of the baseline: no CSF production,
reduced pulsatility and thus decreased dispersion ($0.1 \times R$) and
higher pulsatility with increased dispersion ($10 \times R$)
(\Cref{fig:csf}N). Without CSF production, transport is considerably
delayed. Even after $12$ hours, tracer remains in the subtentorial
regions around the cerebellum, the brain stem and in the surrounding
CSF. Interestingly, the lack of CSF production instead allows tracer
to travel upwards through the ventricular system, reaching the third
ventricle after around $12$ hours. On the other hand, if the CSF
pulsatility is reduced, we observe rapid transport towards the upper
convexity of the cranium, as in the baseline model, but the tracer
spreads exclusively within the anterior regions. This feature can be
attributed to the CSF flow bifurcation posterior to the
  ambient cistern (\Cref{fig:csf}D); without sufficient diffusion, the
  tracer is unable to cross into the posterior SAS. Indeed, with
higher dispersion, the tracer moves through the quadrigeminal cistern
and further upwards into the longitudinal fissure, with also
enrichment of the cerebellum.

\subsection*{Perivascular flow shapes and accelerates molecular enrichment}
\label{sec:pvs_flow_results}

The PVSs are recognized across species as critical pathways for solute
transport in and around the brain\cite{}, and thus as potential
targets for enhancing brain drug delivery and metabolic waste
clearance\cite{}. However, whether CSF flows more rapidly in PVSs and
what the forces and mechanisms required to drive such flow are, remain
as key points of debate~\cite{bohr2022glymphatic,
  van2024caa}. Motivated by experimental observations in animal
models~\cite{iliff2012paravascular, iliff2013cerebral, mestre2018flow,
  bedussi2018paravascular}, there is now a remarkable body of
literature on modelling perivascular fluid flow and
transport~\cite{bilston2003arterial, asgari2016glymphatic,
  rey2018pulsatile, daversin2020mechanisms, sharp2019dispersion,
  thomas2019fluid, kedarasetti2020functional, kedarasetti2020arterial,
  troyetsky2021dispersion, martinac2021phase, gjerde2023directional,
  nozaleda2024arterial}. Here, we ask how these proposed mechanisms
would translate from idealized geometries to human vascular networks
and moreover evaluate their integrated effect in the context of
intracranial solute transport.

Our periarterial network extends from the internal carotid arteries
and basilar artery through \discuss{$\leqslant$ N} generations to
upstream network ends located within the SAS or just inside the
parenchyma (\Cref{fig:results1}A--C, \Cref{fig:pvs}A) and includes
major surface arteries of radius \discuss{0.5--1.4 mm}
(\Cref{fig:pvs}C). Imposing the pressure field induced by CSF
production at the periarterial network ends induces ultraslow CSF flow
of variable direction in these PVSs, with an average velocity of 0.08
$\mu$m/s (antegrade) and a maximum velocity of 0.55 $\mu$m/s
(\Cref{fig:pvs}D, H). On the other hand, traveling waves of arterial
wall motion (\Cref{fig:pvs}B), such as the pulse wave or other
vasomotion~\cite{vanveluw2020vasomotion, munting2023spontaneous,
  bojarskaite2023sleep, broggini2024long}, also induce net directional
flow in the PVS~\cite{kedarasetti2020arterial,
  kedarasetti2020functional, coenen2021lubrication,
  gjerde2023directional, nozaleda2024arterial} -- of magnitude and
direction depending on the amplitude, frequency, and length of the
waves and the characteristics of the perivascular
network~\cite{gjerde2023directional}. Applying a semi-analytic model
of the net flow induced by peristalsis in perivascular
networks~\cite{gjerde2023directional}, we estimate that the cardiac
pulse wave alone, traveling at a frequency of 1 Hz with a wavelength
of 2.0 m and a 1\% wall displacement~\cite{jung2021novel}, will induce
mainly antegrade PVS flow with an average net velocity of 0.92
$\mu$m/s while reaching up to 7.31 $\mu$m/s near larger, ventral
vessels such as the MCA (\Cref{fig:pvs}E, H). The same theory predicts
that strong ultraslow vasomotions, if traveling antegrade at 0.1Hz
with a wavelength of 0.02m and a 10\%
displacement~\cite{broggini2024long}, will induce both retrograde and
antegrade net PVS flow with an average velocity of 13.05 $\mu$m/s and
maximum velocity $54.44$ $\mu$m/s (\Cref{fig:pvs}F, H).

We next study the effect of rapid PVS flow on intracranial molecular
enrichment by comparing the conservative baseline model and a higher
PVS flow model, where the former still includes the net flow
contributions from CSF production and the cardiac pulse wave, while
the latter additionally includes the ultraslow vasomotion
contribution. In both models, tracers were first observed at the basal
artery 48 minutes after injection (\Cref{fig:pvs}G), defined by their
first-time arrival (FTA), the time at which the concentration first
exceeds $0.1$ mmol/l. At all upstream locations along the middle
cerebral arteries (MCAs) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA), we found
substantially reduced FTAs with higher PVS flow (\Cref{fig:pvs}G,
N)\discuss{, up to 3 hours earlier in the M2 segment of the MCA}. Peak
concentrations in the PVS were attained earlier than in the
surrounding tissue (0:48h vs 1:12h at the MCA and 1:00h vs 1:48h at
MCA2) with higher PVS flow, while these peaks were nearly simultaneous
in the baseline. The earlier occurrence and delay in peak time between
the PVS and surrounding tissue clearly indicates the directionality of
tracer enrichment -- it first arrives in the PVS and subsequently
spreads into the tissue and SAS, and especially so with higher PVS
flow. These observations also hold on an aggregated level: computing
the total amount of tracer in the PVS as a function of the distance to
the arterial network roots, we find accelerated tracer transport with
higher PVS flow, especially at earlier time points (2--9 hours)
(\Cref{fig:pvs}I, K). Moreover, differences in tracer transport along
the PVS translate to altered enrichment patterns on the whole-organ
scale. For instance, after 4-6 hours, the faster-moving tracer in the
PVS is clearly visible in the adjacent spaces to the ACA, MCA, and
other arteries (\Cref{fig:pvs}O). In contrast, there are no clear
signs of early enrichment surrounding the PVS in the baseline model
(\Cref{fig:pvs}O).

A natural question is whether early PVS enrichment could be the result
of increased dispersion rather than net flow in the
PVS. Interestingly, adding an effective dispersion of $100 \times$ in
the PVS only induced minor changes in the global spreading rate
compared to the baseline (\Cref{fig:pvs}J, O), thus indicating a
negative answer to this question.

%% We investigate the PVS flow velocities resulting from a transmantle pressure gradient, cardiac peristalsis and vasomotion-induced flow in a reconstructed arterial network and illustrate the effect of the obtained PVS flow fields on the spreading patterns of intrathecally injected tracer. Further, we explore whether solutes move exclusively from the PVS to the SAS, or bidirectionally along both pathways by comparison of first-time arrival times along major cerebral arteries.

%\paragraph{PVS Flow velocities}
%% To investigate PVS flow velocities, we extract the centerlines and associated radii of the arterial network from data \cite{hodneland2019new}, and label the main cerebral arteries (Figure 3A+C). We consider three different PVS flow fields: flow driven by CSF production-induced pressure differences, cardiac peristaltic flow, and vasomotion peristaltic flow (\Cref{fig:pvs}B). Pressure-driven flow velocities are computed by solving one-dimensional flow equations with pressure boundary conditions derived from the production field. Cardiac- and vasomotion-driven PVS flow velocities are obtained from semi-analytical estimates for peristaltic flow, assuming a frequency of 1\,Hz, a 1\,\% radius change, and a wavelength of 2 meters for cardiac flow, and a frequency of 0.1\,Hz, a 10\,\% radius change, and a wavelength of 2\,cm for vasomotion.

%% The production-driven pressure gradient induces low flow velocities, with an average velocity of 0.08\,\textmu m and a maximum velocity of 0.55\,\textmu m (\Cref{fig:csf}D+H). In contrast, cardiac-driven velocities are approximately one order of magnitude higher, with an average velocity of 0.92\,\textmu m and a maximum velocity of 7.31\,\textmu m (\Cref{fig:pvs}E+H). Vasomotion-driven PVS flow reach substantially higher velocities, up to 54\,\textmu m, with an average of 13.05\,\textmu m. For all drivers of PVS flow, the majority of flow occurred in the direction of blood flow, with only a small fraction in the opposing direction (\Cref{fig:pvs}H).

%\paragraph{Differences in PVS flow velocities substantially alter tracer enrichment patterns around major cerebral arteries}

%% Using the computed PVS flow velocities, we predict the effect of rapid PVS flow on intracranial transport by comparing a slow transport model (pressure-driven and cardiac-driven PVS flow) with a high-velocity model that accounts for all three mechanisms (pressure-, cardiac-, and vasomotion-driven). In both models, tracers were first observed 48 minutes after injection at the basal artery (\Cref{fig:pvs}G), defined by the first-time arrival (FTA), the time at which concentration first exceeds $0.1\,$mmol/l.

%% At all upstream locations along the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA), we found substantially reduced FTAs in the rapid PVS flow model (\Cref{fig:pvs}G+N). Furthermore, peak concentrations in the PVS were attained earlier than in the surrounding tissue (0:48h / 1:12h at the MCA and 1:00h / 1:48h at MCA2) in the vasomotion model, while concentrations peaked more simultaneously in the low-velocity model. The earlier occurrence and delay in peak time between the PVS and surrounding tissue indicate the directionality of tracer enrichment — it first arrives in the PVS and subsequently spreads into the tissue and SAS, especially in the vasomotion model.

%% The difference in tracer spreading observed at the MCA/ACA points also holds on an aggregated level in the whole arterial PVS. Computing the total amount of tracer in the PVS depending on the distance to the arterial network's inlet nodes (basal artery (BA), left internal carotid artery (ICA-L), or right internal carotid artery (ICA-R)), we find more rapid transport of tracer in the vasomotion model. We also investigate the potential effect of increased dispersion in the PVS, finding that adding a dispersion enhancement factor of 100 in the PVS only induced minor changes in the global spreading rate (\Cref{fig:pvs}J). However, differences in tracer transport along the PVS translate to altered enrichment patterns on a whole-organ scale. For instance, after 4-6 hours, the faster-moving tracer in the PVS is clearly visible in the adjacent spaces of the ACA, MCA, and other arteries in sagittal, coronal, and axial planes of the whole organ (\Cref{fig:pvs}O). In contrast, the model with only pressure- and cardiac-driven PVS flow does not exhibit clear signs of accelerated tracer transport along the PVS.

\subsection*{Structural versus functional compartmentalization of perivascular spaces}

Human and rodent observations indicate that tracers concentrate in perivascular spaces surrounding the pial and subarachnoid vasculature \cite{zhang1990interrelationships,zhang1992directional,eide2024functional, mestre2018flow}. However, it remains unclear whether such enrichment patterns necessitate a structural barrier, such as a semi-permeable membrane, or if they could result from enhanced flow or mixing (\Cref{fig:compartmentalization}A). Here, we investigate how the permeability of the interface between the PVS and surrounding CSF affects tracer enrichment around the major arterial trunks (\Cref{fig:compartmentalization}B).

Based on the high PVS velocity model from the previous section, we compare a high and low permeability model, corresponding to functional and structural compartmentalization, respectively. For the low permeability model, we set the permeability to $3.8 \cdot 10^{-7}\,$m/s, consistent with previous estimates for the endfoot sheath surrounding penetrating arterioles \cite{koch2023estimates}, which we consider a lower bound for the permeability between CSF and PVS. For the high permeability model, we increase the permeability by a factor of 100.
At the basal artery (BA), tracer appears after less than one hour in the CSF surrounding the BA in both models \Cref{fig:compartmentalization}C and E). In the high permeability model, tracer quickly crosses into the PVS, resulting in similar peak concentrations of 25\,mmol/l in the PVS and at its outer surface, while values up to 50\,mmol/l are attained in the vicinity. In contrast, the low permeability model exhibits substantially lower perivascular tracer enrichment, with a maximum concentration of 10\,mmol/l after approximately two hours.
%The high permeability model allows for more tracer crossing into the PVS, leading to higher concentrations further downstream. Notably, crossover into the parenchyma is also observed, most clearly at 4 hours.
For the middle cerebral arteries (MCA-R and MCA-L), tracer appears first in the PVS in both models, with higher concentrations in the high permeability model (up to 24/21 mmol/l (R/L) peak concentration). In the high permeability model, tracer leaks out of the PVS and spreads in the Sylvian fissure. With a small delay (see \Cref{fig:compartmentalization}F for peak time difference), more tracer appears via the CSF pathway.

At the anterior cerebral artery (ACA-2), the first tracer arrival in the PVS occurs after 3 hours, with a peak at 5 hours. The peak in the PVS is followed shortly by a higher peak in the CSF, indicating tracer arrival through a second pathway, i.e., through the CSF-filled space outside of the PVS. Similar patterns are observed for ACA-A3.

Summarizing and quantifying these observations (\Cref{fig:compartmentalization}F), we find that both first-time arrival and peak time are not substantially affected by the PVS-CSF permeability, while the concentration difference between the PVS and its surrounding CSF quickly decreases with higher permeability, as does the time lag between the peaks in these domains. 
This indicates that fast transport along the PVS might not hinge upon a structural compartmentalization of the PVS, whereas a sharp concentration gradient between PVS and CSF is unlikely without a restricting barrier.

\section*{Discussion}


\subsection*{Summary of findings}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Presented a holistic and integrated in-silico model of molecular
  enrichment in human intracranial spaces allowing for individualized
  predictions of molecular enrichment in human intracranial spaces and
  how physiological pulsations such as variations in respiration or
  cardiac pulsatility or pathological conditions such as enlarged
  perivascular spaces.
\item
  A key observation is that the balance between CSF production and
  intracranial pulsatility strongly shapes the large scale features of
  molecular enrichment patterns: this well-explains the large
  individual variations in enrichment observed
  clinically~\cite{ringstad2018brain}.
\item
  Even slow (0.1--1.0 $\mu$m/s) mean CSF flow in the surface PVS gives
  earlier tracer enrichment around the major cerebral arteries, but
  the effect is more pronounced with up 3 hours difference in time of
  arrival with higher PVS flow of the order 10 $\mu$m/s.
\item
  Rigorously-derived models of PVS flow in perivascular networks based
  on first-principles naturally yield both retrograde and antegrade
  flow, both in the presence of pressure differences at the network
  ends, but also in the absence of such a pressure difference. 
\item
  The PVS may function as highways, facilitating rapid transport, even
  without the presence of structural barriers; but a sharp
  concentration difference between the PVS and surroundings is
  unlikely without it.

\paragraph{CSF flow model validation}

Hornkjøl et al \cite{hornkjol2022csf} model CSF flow induced by production in the choroid plexus and report a peak velocity of $8.9\,$mm/s in the aqueduct. Given that similar flow rates were enforced, the deviation from our value of $2.0\,$mm/s is likely due to differences in diameter of the reconstructed aqueduct. Additionally, their peak velocities in the SAS range between 20 - 50 $\mu\,$m/s, which is compatible with our mean velocity of $4.4\,\mu$m/s (\Cref{fig:csf_flow_histo}).

The aqueductal ($0.31\,$ml/s) and craniocervical ($8.31\,$ml/s) flow rates predicted by our model align well with previously reported values of $0.31\,$ml/s peak aqueductal flow rate \cite{vinje2019respiratory} and about $9\,$ml/s peak net blood inflow into the cranium \cite{baledent2014imaging}. Further, Linninger et al \cite{linninger2007cerebrospinal} model cardiac-induced CSF flow and predict a maximum transmantle pressure difference of $10\,$Pa, which is in good agreement with our estimate of $8.5\,$Pa as well as clinically measured mean pressure differences of $11.5\,$Pa between sensors placed subdurally and in the lateral ventricle \cite{vinje2019respiratory}.
% 10.7 cm/s CSF flow at the craniovertebral junction in control \cite{bapuraj2016cerebrospinal}, area difference?

Sharp et al used the theory of dispersive mixing to predict a dispersion enhancement factor of $91.8$ in the (open) spinal SAS, which lies well within the range of our spatially varying estimate (ranging from 0 to 160). Conversely, \cite{ray2021quantitative} report up to 10,000 times greater diffusion in perivascular regions, but their modelling lumps diffusive, dispersive and advective transport in a single enhancement factor and is thus not directly comparable.

The absolute and relative roles of different transport mechanisms in
the parenchyma is more controversial: diffusion clearly plays a role
\cite{nicolson}, the low permeability of the extracellular space
hinders significant convection neuropil \cite{holter}, (estimates on
the order of 1-10 $\mu$/min) in humans \cite{vinje2023human} and cats
\cite{cserr}, possibly focused on perivascular spaces along
penetrating vessel.

\subsection*{Limitations}

In terms of limitations, ...

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Not all of the injected tracer get to the craniocervical
  junction. What is the impact of this. Linear effect, just scale the
  our predicted values e.g.~in \Cref{fig:results1}.
\item 
  Inaccuracies in vascular geometry representation - and consequences
  downstream for e.g. numerical integration. PVS geometry assumptions
  and approximations. Humans different from mice. Limitations in
  resolution. No vasculature in the cerebellum, and of course no
  vasculature below certain resolution.
\item
  Very simplified model of transport in the parenchyma, no PVS there,
  no glymphatics there. Clearly have an effect on the later stage
  transport in the brain, though the current model provides a baseline
  for comparison, accounting for isotropic diffusion alone.
  Accounting for brain diffusive anisotropy. Little effect
  expected. Maybe something to consider in small follow-up
  work. Interestingly, blobs match observations of large molecular
  tracer observations.
\item
  Assumed no transport across the BBB. PVS-blood exchange and BBB
  leakage. Natural to consider in model variation here, or follow-up
  work. We here ignore PVS-blood exchange, and thus only model the
  perivascular concentration at the network level (in addition to the
  SAS/brain concentration in the surroundings).

\section*{Methods}

%\mer{MER: I recommend writing each (sub)section of Methods as a nearly stand-alone paragraph. Let's see if we can avoid subsubsections/paragraphs. If you need to add more detail than you think is appropriate, put it in a Supplementary Methods section in the Appendix.} 

\subsection*{Intracranial compartments: ventricular system, SAS, and brain parenchyma}

From T1-weighted MR images of a human subject~\cite{hodneland2019new},
we first automatically segment the brain parenchyma and CSF spaces,
including the ventricular system and SAS, using
Synthseg~\cite{billot2023robust,billot2023synthseg}. We next manually
adjust the segmentation to accurately represent the connections
between CSF spaces (aqueduct, median aperture, tentorium cerebelli), smoothen, and finally
extract surface representations of the outer (arachnoid) boundary, the
pial membrane and other interfaces. Conforming to these surface and
interface representations, we generate a tetrahedral mesh $\Omega$
representing the complete intracranial volume as the union of the
parenchyma $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ and CSF spaces $\Omega_{\rm CSF}$, using
fTetWild~\cite{hu2020fast}. The resulting computational mesh consists
of $221\,988$ vertices and $1\,225\,774$ mesh cells, which vary between
$0.24$ mm and $1.29$ cm in mesh cell diameter. The parenchyma has a
total volume of $1318$ ml, whereas the ventricles and the outer SAS
contribute $32$ ml and $328$ ml, respectively, to a total CSF volume
of $360$ml, in agreement with recent estimates~\cite{hladky2024regulation}.

%% In addition, we slightly modify the segmentation to ensure correct
%% connectivity of the ventricular system. In particular, we elongate
%% the aqueduct and enforce no communication between the ventricles
%% and the surrounding CSF spaces except for the median aperture.
%% After morphological smoothing of the segmented image, we extract
%% surface representations of the outer SAS boundary, the pial
%% membrane and the components of the ventricular system.

%% Note that the widely reported value of $150$\,ml of intracranial
%% CSF volume is likely an underestimate. Recent estimates indicate
%% that a value of $200$ to $300$\,ml is more accurate (see
%% \cite{hladky2024regulation} and references therein

\subsection*{Periarterial and perivenous spaces}

To represent surface networks of periarterial and perivenous spaces,
we use Kiminaro~\cite{william_silversmith_2021_5539913} to separately
skeletonize time-of-flight angiography (ToF) and quantitative
susceptibility mapping (QSM) images from the same human
subject~\cite{hodneland2019new}. This technique yields networks of
one-dimensional curves, each curve $\Lambda^i$ indicating the
centerline of a blood vessel segment and labeled with its lumen radius
$R_1^i$. We also assign an outer radius $R_2^i > R_1^i$ to each
segment $i$, form the annular cylinder ensheathing $\Lambda^i$ and
define the union of these as the PVS. The periarterial network graph
consists of $12\,708$ edges connected at $12\,562$ inner nodes and
with $147$ end nodes, and the associated domain is denoted by
$\Lambda_a$. We identify three of the end nodes -- corresponding to
the two internal carotid arteries (ICAs) and the basilar artery (BA)
-- as root nodes, and designate the other ends as leaf nodes. The
resulting perivenous network graph consists of $\fixme{N}$ edges
connected at $\fixme{N}$ inner nodes and with $\fixme{N}$ end nodes,
and the associated domain is denoted by $\Lambda_v$. \fixme{Finally, we label
the outer surface of the PVS associated with $\Lambda_a$ and
$\Lambda_v$, by $\Gamma_a$ and $\Gamma_v$ respectively.}

%% The resulting vascular networks are further smoothened using a
%% spline interpolation technique, and represented as graphs with
%% nodes connected by edges.

\subsection*{Molecular transport equations}

We model diffusion, convection, and exchange of a molecular solute in
the PVS networks $\Lambda_a$ and $\Lambda_v$, in the CSF spaces
$\Omega_{\rm CSF}$ and in the brain parenchyma $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ via
a mixed-dimensional transport model~\cite{masri2023modelling} over a
timescale of minutes to hours. Specifically, for $t > 0$, we solve for
a concentration $c = c(x, t)$ in the 3D intracranial compartments ($x
\in \Omega_{\rm CSF}, x \in \Omega_{\rm PAR}$) and for a cross-section
averaged concentration $\hat{c} = \hat{c}(s, t)$ in the periarterial
and perivenous networks ($s \in \Lambda_a, s \in \Lambda_v$) such that
the following equations hold:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
  \partial_t (\phi c) - \nabla \cdot (D \nabla (\phi c) ) + \nabla \cdot (\bm u c ) + \xi (\overline{c} - \hat c ) \delta_\Gamma & = 0 && \quad \quad \mathrm{in} \quad \Omega_{\rm CSF}, \Omega_{\rm{PAR}},
  \label{eq:multi_transport_3d}
  \\ 
  \partial_t (A  \hat c) - \partial_s(\hat D A \partial_s ( \hat c)) +\partial_s(A \hat u \hat c )  +  \xi P (\hat c - \overline{c})  &= 0 && \quad \quad \mathrm{in} \quad  \Lambda_a, \Lambda_v .
  \label{eq:multi_transport_1d}
 \end{alignat}%
\label{eq:multi_transport}%
\end{subequations}%
In~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}, $0 < \phi \leqslant 1$ is the fluid
volume fraction, $D$ and $\hat{D}$ are effective diffusion
coefficients, and $\bm u$ and $\hat{u}$ are fluid (CSF/ISF)
velocities, all defined in the respective compartments; $P = 2 \pi
R_2$ is the perimeter and $A = \pi (R_2^2 - R_1^2)$ the area of the
PVS cross-sections, $\delta_{\Gamma}$ is the Dirac delta function
concentrated on the interfaces $\Gamma_a, \Gamma_v$, the overlined
$\overline{c}$ denotes the average of $c$ over cross-sections of
$\Gamma_a, \Gamma_v$, and $\xi$ is a permeability allowing for
transfer/exchange over the interfaces $\Gamma_a, \Gamma_v$ between the
periarterial and perivenous networks and their surroundings.
Moreover, we model the membrane between the parenchyma and the CSF
spaces as a semi-permeable membrane with permeability coefficient
$\beta_{\rm pia}$. For a complete description of this mathematical
model, see \Cref{sec:more_maths}.

\subsection*{Intracranial influx after intrathecal injection}
To represent molecular influx into the intracranial compartments
following intrathecal injection, without modelling the spinal
compartment explicitly, we prescribe a time-dependent molecular influx
over the interface towards the spinal compartment with the condition
\begin{equation}
  (D \nabla c - \bm u c ) \cdot \bm{n} = g_{\mathrm{influx}},  \quad \mathrm{on}  \quad \Gamma_{\mathrm{SSAS}}.
\end{equation}
In the above, we set
\begin{equation}
  g_\mathrm{influx}(t) = \frac{m_{\rm tot}}{T_{\rm max}^2 |\Gamma_{\rm SSAS}|} \max(0, T_{\rm max} - |t - T_{\rm max}|), 
\end{equation}
which expresses a hat-shaped influx function with a peak at $T_{\rm max}$ and a total tracer injection of $m_{\rm tot}$ (\Cref{tab:parameters}).

\subsection*{Molecular clearance from the intracranial space and perivascular network ends}
%\subsection*{Boundary conditions: extracranial efflux and perivascular parenchymal influx}

We model molecular clearance, into the meningeal lymphatics or other
pathways, across the upper, outer (arachnoid) boundary
(\Cref{fig:results1}), proportional to the concentration in the SAS
with a rate constant $\beta_{\rm exit}$. We set a no-flux condition at
the end nodes of the perivascular networks, not allowing for direct
molecular clearance there.

\subsection*{CSF flow in the SAS and ventricular system}
%\label{sec:csf_fluid_vel}

We model CSF as an incompressible Newtonian fluid at low Reynolds and
Womersley numbers via the Stokes equations with viscosity $\mu$, and
account for the convective contribution of the flow induced by CSF
production in the choroid plexus. Specifically, we compute the
velocity $\bm u_{\rm CSF}$ and associated pressure $p_{\rm CSF}$ in
the SAS and ventricular system induced by a constant production at a
rate of $u_{\rm in}$ across the lateral ventricle walls and with
efflux across the upper, outer (arachnoid) boundary with efflux
resistance $R_0$; and then set $\bm u = \bm u_{\rm CSF}$ in
$\Omega_{\rm CSF}$ in~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}
(\Cref{tab:parameters}, \Cref{fig:csf}, see also
\Cref{sec:more_maths}). We do not directly model convection within the
brain tissue (beyond the perivascular spaces), and thus set $\bm u =
0$ in $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ in~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}.

\subsection*{Dispersion in the CSF spaces}

%\label{sec:csf_dispersion}

The pulsatile flow of CSF in the SAS and ventricular system,
associated with the cardiac and respiratory cycles, substantially
enhances molecular diffusion through
dispersion~\cite{taylor1953dispersion, watson1983diffusion,
  asgari2016glymphatic, keith2019dispersion, ray2021quantitative,
  troyetsky2021dispersion}. To account for these dispersive effects,
we compute a spatially-varying dispersion factor $R$ in $\Omega_{\rm
  CSF}$ (\Cref{fig:csf_flow_R}) by combining a computational model of
the CSF pressure gradient at peak arterial dilation with theoretical
estimates for shear-augmented (Taylor) dispersion
\cite{taylor1953dispersion, watson1983diffusion, keith2019dispersion}. \mer{Include 1-2 sentences from Supplementary Methods here -- but which? And also revisit references with MC.}

\mer{MER: Stopped here. WIP in Supplementary Methods. }

\mer{MER: Moved the below from Results.}
\mar{To examine cardiac-driven dispersion, we compute a steady CSF flow field at peak systolic blood inflow. We mimic the resulting reduction of CSF space volume by imposing an inflow of $6\,$ml/s \cite{baledent2014imaging, causemann2022human} and $0.31\,$ml/s \cite{vinje2019respiratory} across the upper arachnoid mater ($\Gamma_{\rm AM-U}$) and the lateral ventricle ($\Gamma_{\rm LV}$) surface, respectively. We allow free outflow into the spinal SAS ($\Gamma_{\rm SSAS}$). In addition, we upscale the obtained pressure field to account for the lack of pulsatile inertial effects in our model (see \Cref{sec:csf_dispersion}). In this scenario, we observe a pressure drop of $10\,$Pa between lateral ventricles and the spinal SAS and a maximum flow velocity of $19.8\,$cm/s in the aqueduct (\Cref{fig:csf}F and J).
Next, we estimate a spatially varying dispersion enhancement factor $R$ from cardiac-induced pulsatility by combining the computed pressure field with the theory of shear-augmented dispersion (see \Cref{sec:csf_dispersion}). Assuming a cardiac frequency of $1\,$Hz, we find that cardiac-induced pulsatile CSF flow increases the effective diffusion by more than two orders of magnitude in the aqueduct and around the cisterna magna, but has little effect in most of the SAS ($R < 1$) (\Cref{fig:csf} G and K). }

% respiratory pulsatility
\mar{Employing the same methodology, we estimate the respiratory contribution to dispersive mixing by computing the CSF flow field driven by an inflow of $0.121\,$ml/s \cite{liu2024using} and $1\,$ml/s \cite{gutierrez2022effect} across the lateral ventricular wall and the arachnoid mater, respectively. This amounts to a respiratory peak flow volume of $1.121\,$ ml/s at the craniocervical junction. While the resulting flow velocities are only about one fourth of their cardiac-induced counterparts (see \Cref{fig:csf}H and L), respiratory dispersive mixing reaches a factor of up to 350 due the lower respiratory frequency of $0.25\,$Hz (\Cref{fig:csf}I and M).}

\subsection*{Perivascular fluid flow induced by CSF pressure differences}

To estimate the contribution to perivascular fluid flow from CSF
production, we impose the fluid pressure $p_{\rm CSF}$ induced by CSF
production, computed in the SAS and ventricular system, at the network
end nodes: $\hat{p}(n) = p_{\rm CSF}(n)$ for network end nodes $n$
located within the SAS. For the network end nodes located within the
parenchyma, we compute a harmonic extension of the CSF pressure field
(by solving a Laplace equation in $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ with $p_{\rm
  CSF}$ as the boundary value), and set the corresponding value at
these end nodes. \mer{One sentence about network flow model (Darcy
  flow here). Both arterial and venous networks.}

%% For that reason, we apply a simple extension technique to map the CSF
%% pressure field into $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$. In particular, we solve a
%% Laplace equation on $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ with the CSF pressure on the
%% Pial membrane ($\Gamma_{\rm Pia}$) as a boundary condition.


\subsection*{Dispersion in the PVS}

Similar to the CSF spaces, dispersion due to cardiac and respiratory pulsation has been hypothesized to enhance transport in the perivascular spaces. However, recent estimates indicate that the effect of dispersion does not exceed a factor of 2 compared to diffusion alone \cite{asgari2016glymphatic,keith2019dispersion,bojarskaite2023sleep,asgari2016glymphatic,troyetsky2021dispersion}, and we thus do not model dispersive effects in the PVS. 
\mar{Maybe we should just take a factor of 2 as the upper bound?}

% \cite{keith2019dispersion}: dispersion in PVS is negligiable in porous PVS, but might be relevant in open PVS (R=220) (theoretical estimates)

\subsection*{Perivascular fluid flow induced by vascular wall motion}

Using the theoretical framework introduced by Gjerde et
al.~\cite{gjerde2023directional}, we compute analytic estimates for
the time-average perivascular flow rate $\langle Q' \rangle$ induced
by rhythmic vascular wall motions for different frequencies $f$,
amplitudes $\varepsilon$ and wave lengths $\lambda$ in the arterial
network $\Lambda^a$ (see also Supplementary
Methods~\ref{sec:sup:peristalsis}). The corresponding contribution to
the convective velocity $\hat{u}_{\rm x}$ is defined vessel-wise as
$\hat{u}_{\rm x}|_{\Lambda_i} = \langle Q'_i \rangle/A_i$ where $A_i$
is the cross-section area of the PVS segment ($A_i = \pi (R_2^i -
R_1^i$)) and $\langle Q_i' \rangle$ is its mean flow rate. Two wall
motion patterns are considered: \emph{cardiac} pulsations with $f =
1.0$ (Hz), $\lambda = 2000$ (mm) and $\varepsilon = 1\%$, and very
low-frequency \emph{vasomotion} with $f = 0.1$ (Hz), $\lambda = 20$
(mm), and $\varepsilon = 10\%$. \mer{The corresponding net convective
velocities (in the antegrade direction) are for \emph{vasomotion}:
$9.345 \pm 6.695$ $\mu$m/s, range: $(-65.81, 63.96) \mu$m/s, and for
\emph{cardiac}: $0.475 \pm 0.5115 \mu$m/s, range: $(- 3.825, 4.861)
\mu$m/s, where negative velocities correspond to retrograde flow
(\Cref{fig:pvs}\mer{X}).} No perivascular fluid flow induced by wall
motion is considered for the venous network.


\subsection*{Model and material parameters}

Model and material parameters are summarized in \Cref{tab:parameters}.
We assume that the porosity equals the extracellular space volume
fraction $\phi = \phi_{\rm PAR}$ within the parenchyma and $\phi = 1$
elsewhere. In influx scenarios, we model the concentration of
Gadubutrol with effective diffusion coefficient equal to that of
Gadubutrol in free water in the PVS networks: $\hat{D} = D^{\rm Gad}$;
weighted by a dispersion factor $R$ in the CSF spaces:
$D|_{\Omega_{\rm CSF}} = ( 1 + R) D^{\rm Gad}$; and modulated by the
porosity and tortuosity ($\lambda = 1.78$) in the parenchyma:
$D|_{\Omega_{\rm PAR}} = D^{\rm Gad}_{\rm PAR}$. We set $\xi$
depending on whether the PVS segment is fully embedded within the CSF
spaces ($\xi = \xi_{\rm CSF}$) or parenchyma ($\xi = \xi_{\rm EF}$),
or neither (\Cref{sec:more_maths}). Additionally, we increase the
permeability $\xi$ ($100\times$) near the leaf nodes of $\Lambda_a$ to
account for the transition from explicitly resolved PVSs to their
unresolved continuation in the CSF spaces and parenchyma. \mer{MER:
Could this be made more clear - what is near? Why a 100?}

\subsection*{Initial conditions}

We set the initial concentrations $c_0, \hat{c}_0$ in the
three-dimensional domain $\Omega$ and networks $\Lambda_a, \Lambda_v$
to be zero for all influx scenarios. For parenchymal
clearance scenarios, we set $c_0 = 1, \hat{c}_0 = 0$.

\subsection*{Numerical approximation of multi-dimensional transport and CSF flow}

\mer{@Rami: Could you draft one paragraph here describing the essential bits of the numerical scheme? I recommend ``describing with words'' to reach relevant audiences. Refer to the Supplementary Methods for details. Mention theoretical expected convergence order.} 

In this section, we provide a brief overview on the employed numerical discretization.  
We refer to \Cref{sec:details_numerical_method} for details. 
Our implementation relies on the FEniCS finite element framework \cite{logg2012automated}; the 3D-1D coupling is handled by its extension FEniCS\textsubscript{ii} \cite{kuchta2020assembly}.
The numerical scheme for the CSF flow equations utilizes polynomial spaces that preserve the divergence free condition \eqref{eq:divergence_equation} on the discrete level \cite{hong2016robust}. This requirement is important for stability in the transport equation, see for example \cite{cesmelioglu2022compatible}. The spaces we used for the velocity are continuous along the normal direction; continuity of the tangential component is enforced via interior penalty approaches \cite{hong2016robust}.  If the exact solution of \eqref{eq:momentum_equation}--\eqref{eq:divergence_equation} is smooth, then one expects optimal error convergence rates for this approximation. 

For the 3D transport problem, we use the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with weighted averages and upwinding for the convection term \cite{ern2009discontinuous}.  We remark that the choice of DG in the 3D domain is necessary here since  continuous Galerkin methods even when supplemented with artificial diffusion stabilization terms were unstable in our experiments. For the 1D transport problem, we use continuous Galerkin spaces defined over the entire network with additional artificial diffusion stabilization when the 1D velocity is non--zero.  DG methods for the coupled 3D--1D problem have been recently analyzed  where convergence of the method for the elliptic case is established \cite{masri2024discontinuous}. While the analysis is for DG methods for both the 3D and the 1D problem, we expect similar arguments to hold here. However, note that the 3D--1D coupling induces a singularity in the 3D solution and one can only expect suboptimal error rates near the 1D network. In subdomains excluding the 1D lines, almost optimal rates can be expected for both DG methods \cite{masri2023discontinuous} and CG methods \cite{koppl2016local}.  Extension of the convergence analysis to convection--diffusion problems is an interesting future research direction.

  \caption{Overview of models (-- denotes as immediately above). Each
    PVS cross-section is modelled as a concentric annulus with inner
    radius $R_1$ and outer radius $R_2$ and such that $R_2 = \beta
    R_1$ with $\beta = 2.0$ based on~\cite{eide2024functional}. Let
    $\xi = \dots$ denote the permeability estimated by Koch et
    al.~\cite{koch2023estimates}. Model A and its variations aims to
    quantify the effect of PVS sheaths by varying the permeability
    $\xi$ between the PVS and its surroundings. We consider a fixed
    permeability $\xi_{\rm PVS-PAR}$ based
    on~\cite{koch2023estimates}. \mer{The permeability between the PVS
      and the SAS $\xi_{\rm PVS-SAS}$ must likely be estimated by a
      bit of trial-error from the observations of timings of PVS-SAS
      and SAS from~\cite{eide2024functional}.} \discuss{The
      extracranial solute efflux permeability $\beta_{\rm efflux}$ is
      uniformly distributed over the outer SAS boundary with a
      reasonable rate as baseline\cite{hornkjol2022csf,
        eide2021clinical, ringstad2024glymphatic}.} At baseline, the
    effective diffusion coefficients $D^{\rm x}_{\rm SAS} = D^{\rm
      x}_{\rm PVS}$ of the SAS and PVS represent the free diffusion
    coefficient of Gadubutrol (${\rm x} = {\rm gad}$) in CSF (water),
    and $D^{\rm x}_{\rm PAR}$ the effective diffusion coefficient of
    human cortical tissue, all at body temperature; weighted by a
    dispersion factor $\alpha$ (see Methods). At baseline, we consider
    net flow due to CSF-production in the SAS and PVS:
    $\mathbf{u}_{\rm SAS} > 0$ and $\hat{u} > 0$ (see Methods) but no
    bulk flow in the parenchyma $\mathbf{u}_{\rm PAR} = 0$. Due to the
    timescale for human intracranial tracer transport (minutes to
    hours) compared to typical (cardiac, respiratory, slow vasomotion)
    human intracranial pulsatility (0.1 -- 1 Hz), we consider net
    (constant-in-time) flow fields only in subsequent model variations
    (but see dispersion factor above).  Model B represents
    perivascular pathway scenarios with more rapid flow in the PVS
    induced by vasomotion (PVS I)~\cite{gjerde2023directional}.
    Models C represents a version of the aforementioned scenarios but
    for studying metabolite clearance (instead of solute influx).}
