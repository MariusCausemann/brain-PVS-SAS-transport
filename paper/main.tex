\section*{Introduction}

% What is the big picture problem and why is it important? 
The mechanisms underlying molecular transport within the intracranial
space are fundamental to human brain health and
function. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease are all associated with
abnormal accumulation of protein aggregates together with alterations
in transport and clearance
characteristics~\cite{rasmussen2018glymphatic, harrison2020impaired,
  eide2023plasma, liu2024glymphatic}. Moreover, sleep and conversely
sleep-deprivation play a definite yet enigmatic role in modulating
molecular enrichment and clearance~\cite{xie2013sleep, eide2021sleep,
  eide2022altered, miao2024brain}. In the last decade, established
theories have been challenged by new findings revealing a greater
degree of molecular movement and exchange~\cite{iliff2012paravascular,
  ringstad2017glymphatic, louveau2017understanding,
  proulx2021cerebrospinal, bohr2022glymphatic}, as well as substantial
variability in enrichment and clearance between individuals and
between patient cohorts~\cite{ringstad2018brain, eide2021direction,
  eide2021impaired, eide2022altered}. These observations provide
distinct opportunities (and challenges) for personalized medicine
e.g.~for tailored intrathecal delivery of
chemotherapy~\cite{lohela2022glymphatic} and for early diagnostics of
impaired brain clearance~\cite{eide2021clinical,
  van2024human}. \textcolor{lightgray}{In spite of their importance,
  our understanding of these mechanisms is incomplete with open
  challenges and controversies -- in part relating to the transfer of
  knowledge between species, experiments/studies, cohorts, individual
  variations}

Perivascular pathways along the brain surface and within the brain
parenchyma have long been hypothesized to serve a designated role in
this context~\cite{rennels1985evidence, zhang1990interrelationships,
  ichimura1991distribution, carare2008solutes, iliff2012paravascular,
  foley2012realtime, hannocks2018molecular}. Recently, Eide and
Ringstad~\cite{eide2024functional} and Yamamoto et
al~\cite{yamamoto2024perivascular} independently demonstrated that
PVSs define preferential pathways for molecular transport also in
humans, with delayed periarterial enrichment in dementia
subtypes~\cite{eide2024functional}. \mar{mention that most data stems from rodent, or remove 'also'?} Perivascular flow of CSF clearly
contributes to this transport, and is inherently associated with
vascular pulsations~\cite{hadaczek2006perivascular, iliff2013cerebral,
  bedussi2018paravascular, mestre2018flow, boster2023artificial,
  hirschler2024region}. Fluid mechanics point at intracranial pressure
differences and shorter wavelength vascular wall pulsations as drivers
of directional net flow and convection in the
PVS~\cite{bilston2003arterial, rey2018pulsatile,
  daversin2020mechanisms, kedarasetti2020functional,
  gjerde2023directional, nozaleda2024arterial}, while longer waves
such as the pulse wave primarily contribute to oscillatory flow and
dispersion~\cite{asgari2016glymphatic, sharp2019dispersion,
  kedarasetti2020arterial, troyetsky2021dispersion,
  martinac2021phase}. In the bigger picture, CSF is produced by the
choroid plexus~\cite{damkier2013cerebrospinal,
  steffensen2018cotransporter, liu2020direct}, pulsates through the
ventricular system, cisterns, and SAS in synchrony with cardiac,
respiratory, and neural waves~\cite{wagshul2011pulsating,
  sweetman2011cerebrospinal, fultz2019coupled, vinje2019respiratory,
  eide2021direction, causemann2022human, williams2023neural,
  zimmermann2023total}, and drains via the dural sinuses, meningeal
lymphatics, cranial nerves, or other outflow
pathways~\cite{proulx2021cerebrospinal}. However, how these
physiological factors and physical mechanisms integrate to enhance (or
impair) human intracranial molecular transport over larger spatial
scales and longer time scales remain unknown. A related key question
is to what extent surface PVSs are separated from the SAS by
structural barriers~\cite{zhang1990interrelationships,
  weller2005microscopic, bedussi2017paravascular,
  pizzo2018intrathecal, mestre2022periarteriolar,
  mollgard2023mesothelium, smets2024perivascular, eide2024functional},
and in turn to what extent such structural compartmentalization is a
prerequisite for effective perivascular transport.
 
% What are our research questions and how do we answer them
In this study, by leveraging geometric model reduction and
mixed-dimensional modelling, high performance computing, and
structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)~\cite{masri2024modelling,
  hodneland2019new}, we introduce an integrated computational model of
intracranial molecular enrichment and clearance. Focusing on the
interplay between perivascular pathways, pulsatility and CSF flow
dynamics, the model predicts the temporal evolution and spatial
distribution of a solute concentration with a detailed geometric
representation of the human SAS and ventricular system, networks of
surface PVSs and the brain
parenchyma. \textcolor{lightgray}{\lipsum[2]}

\subsection*{In-silico predictions of molecular enrichment and clearance after injection}

We used previously published multi-modal MRI
data~\cite{hodneland2019new, FIXME} to construct a mixed-dimensional
(3D-1D) computational model of the human intracranial compartments
including the 3D CSF spaces (ventricular system, cisterns, SAS) and
the brain parenchyma, and in addition a topologically 1D network
representation of PVSs surrounding major arteries and veins embedded
in the SAS (\Cref{fig:results1}A--C).

With the aim of integrate current knowledge from clinical,
experimental and previous in-silico studies to represent the four
major physical and physiological factors influencing the distribution
and evolution of solute within these spaces: (i) diffusion of the
solute in the CSF spaces and parenchyma; (ii) the dispersive effects
of pulsatile CSF flow in the SAS induced by the cardiac and
respiratory effects, (iii) net CSF flow induced by pressure
differences in the bulk spaces and the PVSs induced by CSF production
in the choroid plexues with CSF efflux across the outer cavity, and
net PVS flow induced by peristaltic pumping. 

We numerically simulated the distribution and evolution of a solute
concentration representative of Gadobutrol assuming that the solute
appears in the CSF space at the craniocervical junction. Assumed no
transport accross the BBB.

\subsection*{CSF flow and dispersion shifts enrichment patterns}

Flow of CSF through the SAS and the ventricular system is a crucial driver of transport in the human brain environment.
While cardiac- and respiratory induced oscillatory flow increases mixing, the production of CSF in the choroid plexus creates a steady advective flow within the CSF-filled spaces of the cranium \cite{hornkjol2022csf}. 
We construct a 3D model of the SAS and the ventricular system (\Cref{fig:csf}A,B and C) and compute CSF flow fields for three different scenarios: CSF production in the choroid plexus, CSF flow at systolic peak blood inflow and CSF flow in response to free breathing.

% production flow simulation
To simulate the production-driven flow, we impose an inflow of $400\,$ml/day across the surface of the lateral ventricle and allow a resistive outflow across the upper convexity of the arachnoid mater, leading to a total pressure drop of $26\,$mPa between the production and outflow sites (\Cref{fig:csf}D). A maximum flow velocity of $1.8\,$mm/s is attained in the aqueduct, while the mean velocity in the SAS is $2.6\,\mu$m/s (\Cref{fig:csf} E).

% cardiac pulsatility
Assessing the effect of cardiac-driven dispersion, we compute a steady CSF flow field at peak systolic blood inflow. We mimic the resulting reduction of CSF space volume by imposing an inflow of $6\,$ml/s \cite{baledent2014imaging, causemann2022human} and $0.31\,$ml/s \cite{vinje2019respiratory} across the upper arachnoid mater ($\Gamma_{\rm AM-U}$) and the lateral ventricle ($\Gamma_{\rm VL}$) surface, respectively. We allow free outflow into the spinal SAS ($\Gamma_{\rm SSAS}$). In addition, we upscale the obtained pressure field to account for the lack of pulsatile inertial effects in our model (see \Cref{sec:csf_dispersion}). In this scenario, we observe a pressure drop of $10\,$Pa between lateral ventricles and the spinal SAS and a maximum flow velocity of $19.8\,$cm/s in the aqueduct (\Cref{fig:csf}F and J).
Next, we estimate a spatially varying dispersion enhancement factor $R$ from cardiac-induced pulsatility by combining the computed pressure field with the theory of shear-augmented dispersion (see \Cref{sec:csf_dispersion}). Assuming a cardiac frequency of $1\,$Hz, we find that cardiac-induced pulsatile CSF flow increases the effective diffusion by more than two orders of magnitude in the aqueduct and around the cisterna magna, but has little effect in most of the SAS ($R < 1$) (\Cref{fig:csf} G and K). 

% respiratory pulsatility
Employing the same methodology, we estimate the respiratory contribution to dispersive mixing by computing the CSF flow field driven by an inflow of $0.121\,$ml/s \cite{liu2024using} and $1\,$ml/s \cite{gutierrez2022effect} across the lateral ventricular wall and the arachnoid mater, respectively. This amounts to a respiratory peak flow volume of $1.121\,$ ml/s at the craniocervical junction. While the resulting flow velocities are only about one fourth of their cardiac-induced counterparts (see \Cref{fig:csf}H and L), respiratory dispersive mixing reaches a factor of up to 350 due the lower respiratory frequency of $0.25\,$Hz (\Cref{fig:csf}I and M).


% tracer trajectory of the standard model
Next, we use the computed advective velocity field and dispersion enhancement factors to predict the spreading of $0.5\,$mmol intrathecally injected Gadobutrol in CSF-filled spaces, the parenchymal tissue and PVSs around arteries and veines. We assume pressure-driven flow in arterial and venous PVSs, and cardiac peristaltic flow in the arterial network (\Cref{sec:pvs_flow_results}). One hour post-injection, tracer moves upwards in the SAS frontally of the brainstem,  and quickly reaches supratentorial regions (\Cref{fig:csf}N). Here, it spreads both posteriorly through quadrigeminal cistern and longitudinal fissure, and anteriorly through the outer SAS, reaching the top of the cerebral cortex after around 12 h. After 24h, the tracer covers most of the brains surface (with exception of some posterior regions) and has penetrated several centimeters into the parenchymal tissue.
This pattern of transport is reflected in the mean tracer concentrations in each compartment, where the CSF space reaches its peak of $1.4\,$mmol/l after 2 hours, followed by the the arterial PVS concentration peak ($2.9\,$mmol/l after 4 hours) (\Cref{fig:csf}P).  While the mean concentrations in these compartments fall quickly soon after their peaks, the parenchymal tissue slowly enriches with tracer over the first 24 hours, with a final value of $0.3\,$ mmol/l.
Overall, about 40\,\% of the total amount of tracer remains in the cranium 24\,h post-injection, with the largest share in the CSF (53\,\%), followed by the parenchyma (35\,\%), the venous PVS (8\,\%) and the arterial PVS (5\,\%). (\cref{fig:csf}O).

% tracer trajectory of model variations

Finally, we illustrate the contribution of the respective transport mechanisms comparing the full model (production-driven advection, cardiac- and respiration enhanced dispersion) with three reduced models: No advective velocity field, decreased dispersion ($R \times 0.1$) and increased dispersion ($R \times 10$) (corresponding to lower and higher pulsatilty, respectively) (\Cref{fig:csf}N). Without production induced CSF flow, transport it considerably delayed. After $12\,$h tracer remains in the subtentorial regions around the cerebellum, the brain stem and in the surrounding CSF. Interestingly, the lack of CSF production allows tracer to travel upwards through the ventricular system, reaching the third ventricle after around $12\,$h. The low dispersion model exhibits simililarly rapid transport towards the upper convexity of the cranium as the full model, but predicts tracer spreading exclusively within the anterior regions of the brain. At the flow bifurcation around the midbrain, only the full and high dispersion models feature tracer movement through the quadrigeminal cistern and further upwards into the longitudinal fissure.

\subsection{The significance of perivascular spaces as flow highways}
\label{sec:pvs_flow_results}

Perivascular spaces have emerged as critical pathways for fluid flow and solute transport in the brain, making them potential targets for enhancing brain drug delivery and metabolic waste clearance. The question of potential drivers of rapid fluid flow in PVS and the effects on intracranial solute transport remains a key question in the field. We investigate the PVS flow velocities resulting from a transmantle pressure gradient, cardiac peristalsis and vasomotion-induced flow in a recontructed arterial network and illustrate the effect of the obtained PVS flow fields on the spreading patterns of intrathecally injected tracer. Further, we explore whether solutes move exclusively from the PVS to the SAS, or bidirectionally along both pathways by comparison of first-time arrival times along major cerebral arteries.

\paragraph{PVS Flow velocities}

To investigate PVS flow velocities, we extract the the centerlines and associated radii of the arterial network from data \cite{hodneland2019new}, and label the main cerebral arteries (Figure 3A+C). We consider three different PVS flow fields: flow driven by CSF production-induced pressure differences, cardiac peristaltic flow, and vasomotion peristaltic flow (\Cref{fig:pvs}B). Pressure-driven flow velocities are computed by solving one-dimensional flow equations with pressure boundary conditions derived from the production field. Cardiac- and vasomotion-driven PVS flow velocities are obtained from semi-analytical estimates for peristaltic flow, assuming a frequency of 1\,Hz, a 1\,\% radius change, and a wavelength of 2 meters for cardiac flow, and a frequency of 0.1\,Hz, a 10\,\% radius change, and a wavelength of 2\,cm for vasomotion.

The production-driven pressure gradient induces low flow velocities, with an average velocity of 0.08\,\textmu m and a maximum velocity of 0.55\,\textmu m (\Cref{fig:csf}D+H). In contrast, cardiac-driven velocities are approximately one order of magnitude higher, with an average velocity of 0.92\,\textmu m and a maximum velocity of 7.31\,\textmu m (\Cref{fig:pvs}E+H). Vasomotion-driven PVS flow reach substantially higher velocities, up to 54\,\textmu m, with an average of 13.05\,\textmu m. For all drivers of PVS flow, the majority of flow occurred in the direction of blood flow, with only a small fraction in the opposing direction (\Cref{fig:pvs}H).

\paragraph{Differences in PVS flow velocities substantially alter tracer enrichment patterns around major cerebral arteries}

Using the computed PVS flow velocities, we predict the effect of rapid PVS flow on intracranial transport by comparing a slow transport model (pressure-driven and cardiac-driven PVS flow) with a high-velocity model that accounts for all three mechanisms (pressure-, cardiac-, and vasomotion-driven). In both models, tracers were first observed 48 minutes after injection at the basal artery (\Cref{fig:pvs}G), defined by the first-time arrival (FTA), the time at which concentration first exceeds $0.1\,$mmol/l.

At all upstream locations along the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA), we found substantially reduced FTAs in the rapid PVS flow model (\Cref{fig:pvs}G+N). Furthermore, peak concentrations in the PVS were attained earlier than in the surrounding tissue (0:48h / 1:12h at the MCA and 1:00h / 1:48h at MCA2) in the vasomotion model, while concentrations peaked more simultaneously in the low-velocity model. The earlier occurrence and delay in peak time between the PVS and surrounding tissue indicate the directionality of tracer enrichment — it first arrives in the PVS and subsequently spreads into the tissue and SAS, especially in the vasomotion model.

The difference in tracer spreading observed at the MCA/ACA points also holds on an aggregated level in the whole arterial PVS. Computing the total amount of tracer in the PVS depending on the distance to the arterial network's inlet nodes (basal artery (BA), left internal carotid artery (ICA-L), or right internal carotid artery (ICA-R)), we find more rapid transport of tracer in the vasomotion model. We also investigat the potential effect of increased dispersion in the PVS, finding that adding a dispersion enhancement factor of 100 in the PVS only induced minor changes in the global spreading rate (\Cref{fig:pvs}J). However, differences in tracer transport along the PVS translate to altered enrichment patterns on a whole-organ scale. For instance, after 4-6 hours, the faster-moving tracer in the PVS is clearly visible in the adjacent spaces of the ACA, MCA, and other arteries in sagittal, coronal, and axial planes of the whole organ (\Cref{fig:pvs}O). In contrast, the model with only pressure- and cardiac-driven PVS flow does not exhibit clear signs of accelerated tracer transport along the PVS.

\subsection*{Structural versus functional compartmentalization of perivascular spaces}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Are perivascular spaces functionally or structurally
compartmentalized? Human and rodent observations indicate that tracers
concentrate in perivascular spaces surrounding the pial and
subarachnoid vasculature. Must these spaces be structural i.e.~defined
by semi-permeable structural
membrane~\cite{zhang1990interrelationships, zhang1992directional,
  mestre2018flow, eide2024functional}, or can such
compartmentalization be a result of regions of enhanced flow or
mixing~\cite{bedussi2017paravascular, vinje2021brain}? See also
references in Background.
\item
  Vary the PVS permeability $\xi$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item we vary the permeability  $\xi$ for the baseline model and baseline + VM (1x, 10x, 100x, 1000x).
    \item In \Cref{fig:compartmentalization}, we see small changes in mean concentration values, in both the arterial PVS and the surrounding tissue. Interestingly, the differences seem to become smaller for larger multiples of $\xi$. Consequently, also the change in the difference has a similar pattern - it is sensitive to changes in the permeablity for small values of $\xi$, but becomes increasingly robust with larger permeabilities.
    \item In the difference plot, the dip at 2-3h disappears for larger $\xi$ in both models.
    \item do we need to differentiate the jumps between PVS - PAR and PVS-CSF? Jumps between PVS - PAR should go the zero with $\xi \rightarrow \infty$.
    \item we only look at the mean here - but especially at early time points we have larger concentrations in some PVS parts and zero in most of it
    \item Is the conclusion that a purely functional compartmentalization is possible? If there was no structural barrier, would our velocity estimates still make sense?
\end{itemize}

\section*{Discussion}

\paragraph{CSF flow model validation}

Hornkjøl et al \cite{hornkjol2022csf} model CSF flow induced by production in the choroid plexus and report a peak velocity of $8.9\,$mm/s in the aqueduct. Given that similar flow rates were enforced, the deviation from our value of $2.0\,$mm/s is likely due to differences in diameter of the reconstructed aqueduct. Additionally, their peak velocities in the SAS range between 20 - 50 $\mu\,$m/s, which is compatible with our mean velocity of $4.4\,\mu$m/s (\Cref{fig:csf_flow_histo}).

The aqueductal ($0.31\,$ml/s) and craniocervical ($8.31\,$ml/s) flow rates predicted by our model align well with previously reported values of $0.31\,$ml/s peak aqueductal flow rate \cite{vinje2019respiratory} and about $9\,$ml/s peak net blood inflow into the cranium \cite{baledent2014imaging}. Further, Linninger et al \cite{linninger2007cerebrospinal} model cardiac-induced CSF flow and predict a maximum transmantle pressure difference of $10\,$Pa, which is in good agreement with our estimate of $8.5\,$Pa as well as clinically measured mean pressure differences of $11.5\,$Pa between sensors placed subdurally and in the lateral ventricle \cite{vinje2019respiratory}.
% 10.7 cm/s CSF flow at the craniovertebral junction in control \cite{bapuraj2016cerebrospinal}, area difference?

Sharp et al used the theory of dispersive mixing to predict a dispersion enhancement factor of $91.8$ in the (open) spinal SAS, which lies well within the range of our spatially varying estimate (ranging from 0 to 160). Conversely, \cite{ray2021quantitative} report up to 10,000 times greater diffusion in perivascular regions, but their modelling lumps diffusive, dispersive and advective transport in a single enhancement factor and is thus not directly comparable.

The absolute and relative roles of different transport mechanisms in
the parenchyma is more controversial: diffusion clearly plays a role
\cite{nicolson}, the low permeability of the extracellular space
hinders significant convection neuropil \cite{holter}, (estimates on
the order of 1-10 $\mu$/min) in humans \cite{vinje2023human} and cats
\cite{cserr}, possibly focused on perivascular spaces along

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \mer{MER/MC: How about dispersion in the PVS?}
\item 
  Inaccuracies in vascular geometry representation - and consequences downstream for e.g. numerical integration.
\item
  PVS geometry assumptions and approximations. Humans different from mice. Limitations in resolution.
\item
  No vasculature in the cerebellum, and of course no vasculature below certain resolution.
\item
  Only partially accounting for pulsatility. 
\item
  Accounting for brain diffusive anisotropy. Little effect expected. Maybe something to consider in small follow-up work.
\item
  Permeability and stiffness of the pial membrane
\item
  PVS-blood exchange and BBB leakage. Natural to consider in model variation here, or follow-up work. We here ignore PVS-blood exchange, and thus only model the perivascular concentration at the network level (in addition to the SAS/brain concentration in the surroundings).

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Outlook}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Considering the (maybe) low diffusion in CSF spaces, maybe pure
  advection would be relevant? Both computational and physiological
  implications/interest.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Methods}

%\mer{MER: I recommend writing each (sub)section of Methods as a nearly stand-alone paragraph. Let's see if we can avoid subsubsections/paragraphs. If you need to add more detail than you think is appropriate, put it in a Supplementary Methods section in the Appendix.} 

\subsection*{Intracranial compartments: ventricular system, SAS, and brain parenchyma}

From T1-weighted MR images of a human subject~\cite{hodneland2019new},
we first automatically segment the brain parenchyma and CSF spaces,
including the ventricular system and SAS, using
Synthseg~\cite{billot2023robust,billot2023synthseg}. We next manually
adjust the segmentation to accurately represent the connections
between CSF spaces (aqueduct, median aperture, tentorium cerebelli), smoothen, and finally
extract surface representations of the outer (arachnoid) boundary, the
pial membrane and other interfaces. Conforming to these surface and
interface representations, we generate a tetrahedral mesh $\Omega$
representing the complete intracranial volume as the union of the
parenchyma $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ and CSF spaces $\Omega_{\rm CSF}$, using
fTetWild~\cite{hu2020fast}. The resulting computational mesh consists
of $221\,988$ vertices and $1\,225\,774$ mesh cells, which vary between
$0.24$ mm and $1.29$ cm in mesh cell diameter. The parenchyma has a
total volume of $1318$ ml, whereas the ventricles and the outer SAS
contribute $32$ ml and $328$ ml, respectively, to a total CSF volume
of $360$ml, in agreement with recent estimates~\cite{hladky2024regulation}.

%% In addition, we slightly modify the segmentation to ensure correct
%% connectivity of the ventricular system. In particular, we elongate
%% the aqueduct and enforce no communication between the ventricles
%% and the surrounding CSF spaces except for the median aperture.
%% After morphological smoothing of the segmented image, we extract
%% surface representations of the outer SAS boundary, the pial
%% membrane and the components of the ventricular system.

%% Note that the widely reported value of $150$\,ml of intracranial
%% CSF volume is likely an underestimate. Recent estimates indicate
%% that a value of $200$ to $300$\,ml is more accurate (see
%% \cite{hladky2024regulation} and references therein

\subsection*{Periarterial and perivenous spaces}

To represent surface networks of periarterial and perivenous spaces,
we use Kiminaro~\cite{william_silversmith_2021_5539913} to separately
skeletonize time-of-flight angiography (ToF) and quantitative
susceptibility mapping (QSM) images from the same human
subject~\cite{hodneland2019new}. This technique yields networks of
one-dimensional curves, each curve $\Lambda^i$ indicating the
centerline of a blood vessel segment and labeled with its lumen radius
$R_1^i$. We also assign an outer radius $R_2^i > R_1^i$ to each
segment $i$, form the annular cylinder ensheathing $\Lambda^i$ and
define the union of these as the PVS. The periarterial network graph
consists of $12\,708$ edges connected at $12\,562$ inner nodes and
with $147$ end nodes, and the associated domain is denoted by
$\Lambda_a$. We identify three of the end nodes -- corresponding to
the two internal carotid arteries (ICAs) and the basilar artery (BA)
-- as root nodes, and designate the other ends as leaf nodes. The
resulting perivenous network graph consists of $\fixme{N}$ edges
connected at $\fixme{N}$ inner nodes and with $\fixme{N}$ end nodes,
and the associated domain is denoted by $\Lambda_v$. \fixme{Finally, we label
the outer surface of the PVS associated with $\Lambda_a$ and
$\Lambda_v$, by $\Gamma_a$ and $\Gamma_v$ respectively.}

%% The resulting vascular networks are further smoothened using a
%% spline interpolation technique, and represented as graphs with
%% nodes connected by edges.

\subsection*{Molecular transport equations}

We model diffusion, convection, and exchange of a molecular solute in
the PVS networks $\Lambda_a$ and $\Lambda_v$, in the CSF spaces
$\Omega_{\rm CSF}$ and in the brain parenchyma $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ via
a mixed-dimensional transport model~\cite{masri2023modelling} over a
timescale of minutes to hours. Specifically, for $t > 0$, we solve for
a concentration $c = c(x, t)$ in the 3D intracranial compartments ($x
\in \Omega_{\rm CSF}, x \in \Omega_{\rm PAR}$) and for a cross-section
averaged concentration $\hat{c} = \hat{c}(s, t)$ in the periarterial
and perivenous networks ($s \in \Lambda_a, s \in \Lambda_v$) such that
the following equations hold:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
  \partial_t (\phi c) - \nabla \cdot (D \nabla (\phi c) ) + \nabla \cdot (\bm u c ) + \xi (\overline{c} - \hat c ) \delta_\Gamma & = 0 && \quad \quad \mathrm{in} \quad \Omega_{\rm CSF}, \Omega_{\rm{PAR}},
  \label{eq:multi_transport_3d}
  \\ 
  \partial_t (A  \hat c) - \partial_s(\hat D A \partial_s ( \hat c)) +\partial_s(A \hat u \hat c )  +  \xi P (\hat c - \overline{c})  &= 0 && \quad \quad \mathrm{in} \quad  \Lambda_a, \Lambda_v .
  \label{eq:multi_transport_1d}
 \end{alignat}%
\label{eq:multi_transport}%
\end{subequations}%
In~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}, $0 < \phi \leqslant 1$ is the fluid
volume fraction, $D$ and $\hat{D}$ are effective diffusion
coefficients, and $\bm u$ and $\hat{u}$ are fluid (CSF/ISF)
velocities, all defined in the respective compartments; $P = 2 \pi
R_2$ is the perimeter and $A = \pi (R_2^2 - R_1^2)$ the area of the
PVS cross-sections, $\delta_{\Gamma}$ is the Dirac delta function
concentrated on the interfaces $\Gamma_a, \Gamma_v$, the overlined
$\overline{c}$ denotes the average of $c$ over cross-sections of
$\Gamma_a, \Gamma_v$, and $\xi$ is a permeability allowing for
transfer/exchange over the interfaces $\Gamma_a, \Gamma_v$ between the
periarterial and perivenous networks and their surroundings.
Moreover, we model the membrane between the parenchyma and the CSF
spaces as a semi-permeable membrane with permeability coefficient
$\beta_{\rm pia}$. For a complete description of this mathematical
model, see \Cref{sec:more_maths}.

\subsection*{Intracranial influx after intrathecal injection}
To represent molecular influx into the intracranial compartments
following intrathecal injection, without modelling the spinal
compartment explicitly, we prescribe a time-dependent molecular influx
over the interface towards the spinal compartment with the condition
$(D \nabla c - \bm u c ) \cdot \bm{n} = g_{\mathrm{influx}}$ on
$\Gamma_{\mathrm{SSAS}}$. We set
\begin{equation}
  g_\mathrm{influx}(t) = \frac{m_{\rm tot}}{T_{\rm max}^2 |\Gamma_{\rm SSAS}|} \max(0, T_{\rm max} - |t - T_{\rm max}|)
\end{equation}
which expresses a hat-shaped influx function with a peak at $T_{\rm max}$ and a total tracer injection of $m_{\rm tot}$ (\Cref{tab:parameters}).

\subsection*{Molecular clearance from the intracranial space and perivascular network ends}
%\subsection*{Boundary conditions: extracranial efflux and perivascular parenchymal influx}

We model molecular clearance, into the meningeal lymphatics or other
pathways, across the upper, outer (arachnoid) boundary
(\Cref{fig:intracranial_domains}), proportional to the concentration
in the SAS with a rate constant $\beta_{\rm exit}$. We set a no-flux
condition at the end nodes of the perivascular networks, not allowing
for direct molecular clearance there.

\subsection{CSF flow in the SAS and ventricular system}
\label{sec:csf_fluid_vel}

We model CSF as an incompressible Newtonian fluid at low Reynolds and
Womersley numbers via the Stokes equations with viscosity $\mu$, and
account for the convective contribution of the flow induced by CSF
production in the choroid plexus. Specifically, we compute the
velocity $\bm u_{\rm CSF}$ and associated pressure $p_{\rm CSF}$ in
the SAS and ventricular system induced by a constant production at a
rate of $u_{\rm in}$ across the lateral ventricle walls and with
efflux across the upper, outer (arachnoid) boundary with efflux
resistance $R_0$; and then set $\bm u = \bm u_{\rm CSF}$ in
$\Omega_{\rm CSF}$ in~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}
(\Cref{tab:parameters}, \Cref{fig:intracranial_domains},
\Cref{fig:csf_flow_prod}, see also \Cref{sec:more_maths}). We do not
directly model convection within the brain tissue (beyond the
perivascular spaces), and thus set $\bm u = 0$ in $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$
in~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}.

\subsection{Dispersion in the CSF spaces}
\label{sec:csf_dispersion}

The pulsatile flow of CSF in the SAS and ventricular system,
associated with the cardiac and respiratory cycles, substantially
enhances molecular diffusion through
dispersion~\cite{taylor1953dispersion, watson1983diffusion,
  asgari2016glymphatic, keith2019dispersion, ray2021quantitative,
  troyetsky2021dispersion}. To account for these dispersive effects,
we compute a spatially-varying dispersion factor $R$ in $\Omega_{\rm
  CSF}$ (\Cref{fig:csf_flow_R}) by combining a computational model of
the CSF pressure gradient at peak arterial dilation with theoretical
estimates for shear-augmented (Taylor) dispersion
\cite{taylor1953dispersion, watson1983diffusion, keith2019dispersion}. \mer{Include 1-2 sentences from Supplementary Methods here -- but which? And also revisit references with MC.}

\mer{MER: Stopped here. WIP in Supplementary Methods.}

\subsection*{Dispersion in the PVS}

Similar to the CSF spaces, dispersion due to cardiac and respiratory pulsation has been hypothesized to enhance transport in the perivascular spaces. However, recent estimates indicate that the effect of dispersion does not exceed a factor of 2 compared to diffusion alone \cite{asgari2016glymphatic,keith2019dispersion,bojarskaite2023sleep,asgari2016glymphatic,troyetsky2021dispersion}, and we thus do not model dispersive effects in the PVS. 
\mar{Maybe we should just take a factor of 2 as the upper bound?}

% \cite{keith2019dispersion}: dispersion in PVS is negligiable in porous PVS, but might be relevant in open PVS (R=220) (theoretical estimates)
%  \cite{bojarskaite2023sleep} numerical simulations show that the enhancement factor is likely in the range of 10 - 50 \%
%\cite{asgari2016glymphatic} numerical simulations show increase of 16% to 50%  in distribution lengths
%\cite{troyetsky2021dispersion}:   maximum enhancement of diffusion of only about 5%


\subsection*{Perivascular fluid flow induced by CSF pressure differences}

Since the pressure gradient the caused by the steady production-driven CSF flow (see \cref{sec:csf_fluid_vel}), we impose the precomputed fluid pressure $p_{\rm CSF}$ on the networks root nodes:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{p} = p_{\rm CSF} \quad \text{ on } \Lambda^{\rm out}
\end{equation}
In case that the root does not lie within the CSF-space but the parenchyma, the CSF pressure is not yet computed. For that reason, we apply a simple extension technique to map the CSF pressure field into $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$. In particular, we solve a Laplace equation on $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ with the CSF pressure on the Pial membrane ($\Gamma_{\rm Pia}$) as a boundary condition.


\subsection*{Perivascular fluid flow induced by vascular wall motion}

Using the theoretical framework introduced by Gjerde et
al.~\cite{gjerde2023directional}, we compute analytic estimates for
the time-average perivascular flow rate $\langle Q' \rangle$ induced
by rhythmic vascular wall motions for different frequencies $f$,
amplitudes $\varepsilon$ and wave lengths $\lambda$ in the arterial
network $\Lambda^a$ (see also Supplementary
Methods~\ref{sec:sup:peristalsis}). The corresponding contribution to
the convective velocity $\hat{u}_{\rm x}$ is defined vessel-wise as
$\hat{u}_{\rm x}|_{\Lambda_i} = \langle Q'_i \rangle/A_i$ where $A_i$
is the cross-section area of the PVS segment ($A_i = \pi (R_2^i -
R_1^i$)) and $\langle Q_i' \rangle$ is its mean flow rate. Two wall
motion patterns are considered: \emph{cardiac} pulsations with $f =
1.0$ (Hz), $\lambda = 2000$ (mm) and $\varepsilon = 1\%$, and very
low-frequency \emph{vasomotion} with $f = 0.1$ (Hz), $\lambda = 20$
(mm), and $\varepsilon = 10\%$. \mer{The corresponding net convective
velocities (in the antegrade direction) are for \emph{vasomotion}:
$9.345 \pm 6.695$ $\mu$m/s, range: $(-65.81, 63.96) \mu$m/s, and for
\emph{cardiac}: $0.475 \pm 0.5115 \mu$m/s, range: $(- 3.825, 4.861)
\mu$m/s, where negative velocities correspond to retrograde flow
(\Cref{fig:pvs}\mer{X}).} No perivascular fluid flow induced by wall
motion is considered for the venous network.


\subsection*{Model and material parameters}

Model and material parameters are summarized in \Cref{tab:parameters}.
We assume that the porosity equals the extracellular space volume
fraction $\phi = \phi_{\rm PAR}$ within the parenchyma and $\phi = 1$
elsewhere. In influx scenarios, we model the concentration of
Gadubutrol with effective diffusion coefficient equal to that of
Gadubutrol in free water in the PVS networks: $\hat{D} = D^{\rm Gad}$;
weighted by a dispersion factor $R$ in the CSF spaces:
$D|_{\Omega_{\rm CSF}} = ( 1 + R) D^{\rm Gad}$; and modulated by the
porosity and tortuosity ($\lambda = 1.78$) in the parenchyma:
$D|_{\Omega_{\rm PAR}} = D^{\rm Gad}_{\rm PAR}$. We set $\xi$
depending on whether the PVS segment is fully embedded within the CSF
spaces ($\xi = \xi_{\rm CSF}$) or parenchyma ($\xi = \xi_{\rm EF}$),
or neither (\Cref{sec:more_maths}). Additionally, we increase the
permeability $\xi$ ($100\times$) near the leaf nodes of $\Lambda_a$ to
account for the transition from explicitly resolved PVSs to their
unresolved continuation in the CSF spaces and parenchyma.

\subsection*{Initial conditions}

We set the initial concentrations $c_0, \hat{c}_0$ in the
three-dimensional domain $\Omega$ and networks $\Lambda_a, \Lambda_v$
to be zero for all influx scenarios. For parenchymal
clearance scenarios, we set $c_0 = 1, \hat{c}_0 = 0$.

\subsection*{Numerical approximation of multi-dimensional transport and CSF flow}

\mer{@Rami: Could you draft one paragraph here describing the essential bits of the numerical scheme? I recommend ``describing with words'' to reach relevant audiences. Refer to the Supplementary Methods for details. Mention theoretical expected convergence order.} 

In this section, we provide a brief overview on the employed numerical discretization.  
We refer to \Cref{sec:details_numerical_method} for details. 
Our implementation relies on the FEniCS finite element framework \cite{logg2012automated}; the 3D-1D coupling is handled by its extension FEniCS\textsubscript{ii} \cite{kuchta2020assembly}.
The numerical scheme for the CSF flow equations utilizes polynomial spaces that preserve the divergence free condition \eqref{eq:divergence_equation} on the discrete level \cite{hong2016robust}. This requirement is important for stability in the transport equation, see for example \cite{cesmelioglu2022compatible}. The spaces we used for the velocity are continuous along the normal direction; continuity of the tangential component is enforced via interior penalty approaches \cite{hong2016robust}.  If the exact solution of \eqref{eq:momentum_equation}--\eqref{eq:divergence_equation} is smooth, then one expects optimal error convergence rates for this approximation. 

For the 3D transport problem, we use the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with weighted averages and upwinding for the convection term \cite{ern2009discontinuous}.  We remark that the choice of DG in the 3D domain is necessary here since  continuous Galerkin methods even when supplemented with artificial diffusion stabilization terms were unstable in our experiments. For the 1D transport problem, we use continuous Galerkin spaces defined over the entire network with additional artificial diffusion stabilization when the 1D velocity is non--zero.  DG methods for the coupled 3D--1D problem have been recently analyzed  where convergence of the method for the elliptic case is established \cite{masri2024discontinuous}. While the analysis is for DG methods for both the 3D and the 1D problem, we expect similar arguments to hold here. However, note that the 3D--1D coupling induces a singularity in the 3D solution and one can only expect suboptimal error rates near the 1D network. In subdomains excluding the 1D lines, almost optimal rates can be expected for both DG methods \cite{masri2023discontinuous} and CG methods \cite{koppl2016local}.  Extension of the convergence analysis to convection--diffusion problems is an interesting future research direction.

    on~\cite{koch2023estimates}. \mer{The permeability between the PVS

      reasonable rate as baseline\cite{hornkjol2022csf,

    effective diffusion coefficients $D^{\rm x}_{\rm SAS} = D^{\rm
      x}_{\rm PVS}$ of the SAS and PVS represent the free diffusion
    coefficient of Gadubutrol (${\rm x} = {\rm gad}$) in CSF (water),
    and $D^{\rm x}_{\rm PAR}$ the effective diffusion coefficient of
    human cortical tissue, all at body temperature; weighted by a
    dispersion factor $\alpha$ (see Methods). At baseline, we consider
    net flow due to CSF-production in the SAS and PVS:
    $\mathbf{u}_{\rm SAS} > 0$ and $\hat{u} > 0$ (see Methods) but no
    bulk flow in the parenchyma $\mathbf{u}_{\rm PAR} = 0$. Due to the
    timescale for human intracranial tracer transport (minutes to
    hours) compared to typical (cardiac, respiratory, slow vasomotion)
    human intracranial pulsatility (0.1 -- 1 Hz), we consider net
    (constant-in-time) flow fields only in subsequent model variations
    (but see dispersion factor above).  Model B represents
    perivascular pathway scenarios with more rapid flow in the PVS
    induced by vasomotion (PVS I)~\cite{gjerde2023directional}.
    Models C represents a version of the aforementioned scenarios but
    for studying metabolite clearance (instead of solute influx).}
