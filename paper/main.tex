\section*{Introduction}


Molecular transport in perivascular spaces (PVSs) is established as a key pathway for human brain clearance and delivery. Previous studies indicate that molecules move rapidly in the subarachnoid space (SAS) and in PVSs surrounding pial arteries. Here, we aim to model and study this transport in a full pial perivascular and/or vascular network embedded in the SAS.  

Motivation: as indicated by~\cite{iliff2012paravascular}, referring to
Cserr, Phys Rev., 1971, bulk convective flow may be more important for
larger species (larger distances) and larger molecules.

\section*{Background}

\mer{Point from Miro: Goriely and scaling from mice to men.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Communication between perivascular spaces and the subarachnoid space
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Rennels et al~\cite{rennels1985evidence} infused tracer into the lateral cerebral ventricles and subarachnoid space of cats (and one dog) and observed that the tracer distributed in a perivascular pattern. The tracer distributed more rapidly around arterioles than around capillaries and veins. Importantly, the rapid paravascular influx was modulated by arterial pulsatility and in particular reduced by reduced vessel pulsatility. They directly postulate that ``fluid circulation through the central nervous system occurs via paravascular pathways'', and discuss both mixing and pumping as pulsatility-associated mechanisms for transport. 
  \item
    Weller and coauthors conducted pioneering studies of perivascular spaces, flow and transport~\cite{zhang1990interrelationships, zhang1992directional, weller2005microscopic}. They identified thin sheaths of pial cells surrounding arteries and arterioles (but not veins or venules) on the brain surface and within the human brain itself~\cite{zhang1990interrelationships}. Further, they observed that tracers spread along perivascular (arterial, venous and capillar) spaces in (rat) grey matter, and in the subarachnoid space (to the cribriform plate and nasal lymphatics).   
  \item
    Ichimura et al~\cite{ichimura1991distribution} study the distribution of large molecular weight tracers in the subarachnoid and surface perivascular spaces and within the cortex in rats. They observed rapid spread in perivascular spaces, and that tracers injected into the CSF of the subarachnoid space spread also into subarachnoid and cortical perivascular spaces. In conclusion, they highlight the presence of an extensive perivascular network, and report of some bulk flow, but slow and of variable directionality - in contrast to e.g Rennels et al~\cite{rennels1985evidence}. 
  \item In a series of papers, Bakker and coauthors study perivascular anatomy and solute transport~\cite{bedussi2017paravascular, bedussi2018paravascular}. They find that the subarachnoid space, the cisterns, ventricles and penetrating periarteriolar spaces form a continuous cerebrospinal fluid-filled space surrounding and penetrating into the murine brain \cite{bedussi2017paravascular}. Moreover, they demonstrate pulsatile and directional (antegrade) flow in perivascular (predominantly periarterial) spaces on the brain surface \cite{bedussi2018paravascular}. 
  \item
    Iliff et al~\cite{iliff2012paravascular} observed rapid movement of tracer (injected in the cisterna magna) along the outside of surface arteries and penetrating arterioles in mice, and state this is in agreement with the presence of perivascular sheaths as reviewed by Weller~\cite{weller2005microscopic}.
  \item
    The architecture of perivascular spaces in and around the rat brain was also studied in detail by Thorne and colleagues~\cite{pizzo2018intrathecal, hannocks2018molecular}. Hannocks et al~\cite{hannocks2018molecular} characterize the molecular composition of different perivascular compartments. Pizzo et al~\cite{pizzo2018intrathecal} emphasizes the presence of stomata or pores present on the interface between blood vessels and the CSF in the subarachnoid space. Neither seem to quantitatively report on PVS widths.
  \item Mestre et al~\cite{mestre2022periarteriolar} study the properties of pial perivascular spaces in detail in mice, and in particular the structure and coverage of pial cells and pial layers surrounding leptomeningeal arteries (and arterioles). They report of pial cells forming sheaths for larger ($> 10000 \mu$m$^2$ cross-section lumen area) surface arteries and partially coverage for smaller surface arteries, with higher coverage in ventral SAS regions. They find that these pial layers do not form an impermeable barrier to small molecules. Importantly, they also study the pial coverage in aged and Alzheimer's model mice, and find significant and complex changes in these pial structures.
  \item
    In humans, Eide and Ringstad investigate cerebrospinal fluid tracer transport in the human subarachnoid space after intrathecal injection~\cite{eide2024functional}. They observe tracer enrichment antegrade along the major cerebral arteries, and enrichment of the nearly cerebral cortex. They also consider variations in different patient cohorts and find impaired transport in iNPH patients with increased perivascular space size. They report of tracer enrichment in donut-shaped perivascular spaces. The timings here may be the best estimate of human PVS flow speeds. 
  \item
    Yamamoto et al~\cite{yamamoto2024perivascular} also report of contrast-enhancement in human PVS.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Shapes and sizes of the perivascular spaces\footnote{The area $A$ of
  a circle with inner radius $R_1$ is $A = \pi R_1^2$. The area $A_2$
  of an annulus with inner radius $R_1$ and outer radius $R_2$ is $A_2
  = \pi (R_2^2 - R_1^2)$. The width of this annulus is $R_2 -
  R_1$. The ratio PVS/lumen area can thus be estimated as $A_2/A =
  (R_2^2 - R_1^2)/R_1^2$. For example, if $R_2 = n R_1$ ($n = 2
  \rightarrow$ PVS width equal to lumen radius, $n = 3 \rightarrow$
  PVS width equal to lumen diameter), then $A_2/A = n^2 - 1$. However,
  if the annulus has an elliptic outer boundary with radii $R_a$ and
  $R_b$, then its area is $A_e = \pi (R_a R_b - R_1^2)$, and so in the
  extreme case where $R_a > R_b = R_1$, the area is $\pi R_1 (R_a -
  R_1)$, and the PVS/lumen area ratio is $A_e/A = (R_a -
  R_1)/R_1$. And so, for $R_a = n R_1$, then $A_e/A = n-1$.}. Note
  that representing the surface PVS as annular cylinders is a
  simplification, and several studies emphasize the asymmetric nature
  of the PVS shape~\cite{mestre2018flow, tithof2019hydraulic,
    vinje2021brain, raicevic2023sizes}. Moreover, do not forget that
  the sizes of mice and humans are orders of magnitude apart.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Ichimura et al~\cite{ichimura1991distribution} report on a typical
    perivascular width of $1-10\mu$m, but broader around vessel
    bifurcations in the rat subarachnoid space (fixed specimens).
  \item Foley et al~\cite{foley2012realtime} report on perivascular
    space width within rat cortex of $8-10\mu$m for arterioles of
    $\approx$30$\mu$m in diameter.
  \item
    Schain et al~\cite{schain2017cortical} report on the sizes of pial
    arteries ($6.0-11 \mu$m in diameter\footnote{Schain et
    al~\cite{schain2017cortical} state diameter rather, but the
    diameter does not match with the given area, so perhaps this
    should be the radius}) and veins ($9.4-21\mu$m) in mice, with an
    average PVS/lumen area ratio of $1.26$ for arteries and $0.13$ for
    veins. 
  \item Mestre et al~\cite{mestre2018flow} measure and characterize
    pial perivascular transport and estimate flow magnitudes in
    mice. They report a PVS/lumen area ratio of $1.4 \pm 0.1$ and a
    PVS width of $\approx 40 \mu$m which described as comparable to
    the adjacent artery (diameter). 
\item
  Raicevic et al~\cite{raicevic2023sizes} study the sizes and shapes
  of perivascular spaces surrounding pial arteries in mice in detail,
  in particular the relationship between periarterial space and lumen
  (cross-section) area and its variation with vessel area and
  location. They remark that the variation in PVS area is larger
  between PVS segments than along a single PVS segment. The PVS area
  seems to increase with the vessel area, but an affine approximation
  gives a poor fit, and from inspecting the distribution, the
  relationship seems superlinear. The peak distribution value of
  segmented PVS/lumen area is $1.12$.
  \item
    In terms of size, Bedussi et al.~\cite{bedussi2018paravascular} report a PVS width of $\approx$20$\mu$m surrounding surface arteries branching from the MCA (of diameters $45 \pm 7$ $\mu$m). Note that they include both data from mice and OCT data from humans. They report of human PVS size linearly related with the vessel size (and in the range 0.1--0.35 mm for vessels of diameter 0.1--0.5 mm).
  \item Vinje et al~\cite{vinje2021brain} and references therein illustrates the location and characteristics of human pial perivascular spaces, using human OCT data from the Bakker lab.
  \item Bollman et al~\cite{bollmann2022imaging} image the human pial vasculature at high resolution (7T), and report of pial arterial diameters in the range $50-280 \mu$m.
\item
  Smets et al~\cite{smets2024perivascular} study the size of
  perivascular spaces surrounding pial arteries and veins in mice
  (in-vivo), with particular emphasis on the properties of perivenous
  spaces. They observe the PVS as two ``triangular spaces'' adjacent
  to both arteries and veins, and separated from the subarachnoid
  space by a membrane (see also references
  to~\cite{zhang1990interrelationships, pizzo2018intrathecal,
    mollgard2023mesothelium}). They found that the cross-section area
  of the PVS correlates with the lumen area both for pial arteries
  and veins, but not for penetrating vessels. They report a
  PVS-to-lumen-area ratio of 0.43 for arteries and 0.35 for veins.
\item
  Personal communication (Ringstad, Oct 15 2024)~\cite{eide2024functional}: a typical blood vessel in the M2-segment of the MCA is 1.56 mm in diameter ($2 R_1$) with an annular PVS of width ($R_2 - R_1$) 1.23 mm and total PVS diameter $2 R_2$ of 3.93. In iNPH patients, extreme outliers are observed; e.g. still with annular PVS, but not concentric (shifted vessel), for vessel diameter of 2 mm and PVS width from 1.1 mm to 6.0 mm.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Perivascular hydraulic resistances. The hydraulic resistance of
  perivascular spaces has been studied extensively, with key
  contributions from Thomas, Kelley, Tithof and collaborators~\cite{tithof2019hydraulic}.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Boster et al.~\cite{boster2024hydraulic} study methods of estimating the hydraulic resistance of perivascular spaces via in-vivo imaging-based 3D reconstructions of pial perivascular spaces in mice; they report of hydraulic resistances of the order $1.7 \times 10^6 - 8.9 \times 10^5$ mmHg·min/mL/m).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Perivascular flow characteristics: magnitudes and directionality?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Rennels et al~\cite{rennels1985evidence} highlight in their
    Discussion that
    \begin{quote}
      This evidence of fluid displacement in both directions through
      the perivascular spaces suggest either that influx and efflux
      occur intermittently through the same perivascular spaces or
      that these fluid movements occur via separate populations of
      perivascular spaces.
    \end{quote}
  \item
    Ichimura et al~\cite{ichimura1991distribution} found that albumin in the subarachnoid periarterial space moved 1.5 mm away from the injection site in about 7 minutes, thus a net speed of around $3.6 \mu$m/s. 
  \item
    Hadaczek et al~\cite{hadaczek2006perivascular} studied the role of arterial pulsations in more detail, following up on~\cite{rennels1985evidence}.
  \item Foley et al~\cite{foley2012realtime} study perivascular transport characteristics of nanoparticles injected in the cerebral cortex of rats, though in the context of convection-enhanced delivery.
  \item
    In terms of movement, Bedussi et al~\cite{bedussi2018paravascular} found a net movement of particles in surface PVS (in mice) in the antegrade (same direction as blood flow) direction with an average velocity of $17 \pm 2\mu$m/s, and a mean amplitude of the pulsatile motion of $14 \pm 2 \mu$m.
\item Mestre et al~\cite{mestre2018flow} report a mean (averaged over time and space) flow speed of $18.7 \mu$m/s (root-mean-square velocity?) with net transport in the antegrade direction (near the MCA, in mice).
\item
  Asgari et al~\cite{asgari2016glymphatic} model tracer transport in axial periarterial spaces, highlight the negligible net (directional, bulk) flow induced by arterial wall pulsations at physiologically realistic wavelengths, but also the contributions from wall pulsations to dispersion. 
\item
  Rey and Sartinoranont~\cite{rey2018pulsatile} examine pulsatility as a driver for net flow in perivascular spaces within the brain parenchyma via a hydraulic network models, again highlighting the negligible net flow induced by vascular wall movements, but significant pulsatile flow and thus potential for dispersive effects~\cite{watson1983diffusion, asgari2016glymphatic}.
\item
  Rey et al~\cite{rey2023perivascular} consider a comprehensive ex-vivo perivascular network segmentation in the rat brain following in-vivo intraventricular contrast infusion. They highlight the numerous connections between the ventricular system and the perivascular spaces, including long perivascular segments extending from the surface and deep into the brain. 
\item
  In the context of dispersion, see also~\cite{asgari2016glymphatic, keith2019dispersion, troyetsky2021dispersion}
\item
  Wright et al~\cite{wright2024coupled} study the dynamics (waveforms over time) of human arterial blood flow (with resting-state fMRI) and perivascular CSF flow (with dynDWI, apparent diffusion coefficient (mm$^2$/s)). The waveforms seem coupled, with the arterial peak preceding the CSF peak by around 0.06 (of a cardiac cycle). The report ADC in the PVS on the order $2.5-5.5 \times 10^{-3}$ mm$^2$/s, with alterations in the coupling with age.
\item
  Boster and coauthors~\cite{boster2023artificial, toscano2024infeering} estimate perivascular flow parameters in mice via physics-informed neural networks (e.g.~pressure gradients, hydraulic resistances, shear stresses). Boster et al~\cite{boster2023artificial} estimate PVS pressure gradients on the order of $0.7-5 \times 10^{-4} \unit{Pa/\mu m}$\footnote{Note that 
  \begin{equation}
    1 \times 10^{-4} \, \unit{Pa/\mu m} = 1 \times 10^{2} \, \unit{Pa/m} \approx 100/133 \unit{mmHg/m} \approx 0.75 \unit{mmHg/m}
  \end{equation}
   }, downstream velocity component of $12.75 \pm 6.25 \unit{\mu m/s}$. 
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Broggini et al~\cite{broggini2024long} describe long-wavelength traveling waves of vasomotion (0.1 Hz) in pial arterioles in mice. They find waves traveling in both directions, with waves exiting the surface of the cortex more often than chance (85 of 140 exit). ``The wavelength of the observed pial waves is long, typically 20 mm or twice the length of the mouse cortex (inset in Figure 4C).'', with relative amplitudes in the range 0.02--0.12 in pial arterioles.
\item
  Kedarasetti et al~\cite{kedarasetti2020functional} model functional hyperemia waves (aka stimulus-induced vasomotion, see also van Veluw et al~\cite{vanveluw2020vasomotion}). Note that the directionality of vasomotion is classically thought to be in the opposite direction of the blood flow.
\item
  Note that Gokina et al~\cite{gokina1996electrical} report of spontaneous rhythmic contraction in human pial arteries.
\end{enumerate}
Cerebrospinal fluid flow
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Sweetman and Linninger~\cite{sweetman2011cerebrospinal} model the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the cranial and spinal subarachnoid space of a healthy human driven by pulsatile displacement of the upper walls of the lateral ventricles representing volumetric changes of the vasculature, with model predictions in good agreement with clinical observations of CSF velocity magnitude and stroke volume. 
\item Causemann et al.~\cite{causemann2022human}
\item
  Vinje et al.~\cite{vinje2019respiratory} consider clinical measurements of intracranial pressure differences and human CSF-space geometries together with computational modelling to study CSF flow patterns in the aqueduct. They estimate the pressure gradient across the cerebral aqueduct resulting from a CSF production of 0.5L/day to be $0.009 \pm 0.006$ mmHg/m.

\subsection*{II: CSF flow}


Flow of CSF through the SAS and the ventricular system is a crucial driver of transport in the human brain environment.
While cardiac- and respiratory induced oscillatory flow increases mixing, the production of CSF in the choroid plexus creates a steady advective flow within the CSF-filled spaces of the cranium \cite{hornkjol2022csf}. 
We construct a 3D model of the SAS and the ventricular system (\Cref{fig:csf}A,B and C) and compute CSF flow fields for three different scenarios: CSF production in the choroid plexus, CSF flow at systolic peak blood inflow and CSF flow in response to free breathing.

% production flow simulation
To simulate the production-driven flow, we impose an inflow of $400\,$ml/day \cite{nilsson1992circadian} across the surface of the lateral ventricle and allow a resistive outflow across the upper convexity of the arachnoid mater, leading to a total pressure drop of $26\,$mPa between the production and outflow sites. A maximum flow velocity of $1.8\,$mm/s is attained in the aqueduct, while the mean velocity in the SAS is $2.6\,\mu$m/s (\Cref{fig:csf} E).

%The Stokes system is solved with the finite element software $FEniCS$, stored and then subsequently read for all the relevant solute transport simulations. See Figure~\ref{fig:csf} for a streamline visualization of the obtained velocity profile and \Cref{sec:details_numerical_method} for details on the numerical algorithm employed.

% cardiac pulsatility
Assessing the effect of cardiac-driven dispersion, we compute a steady CSF flow field at peak cranial blood volume during the cardiac cycle. We mimic resulting the reduced CSF space volume by imposing an inflow of $8\,$ml/s \cite{baledent2014imaging} and $0.31\,$ml/s \cite{vinje2019respiratory} across the arachnoid mater and the lateral ventricle surface, respectively. We allow free outflow into the spinal SAS. In addition, we upscale the obtained pressure field to account for the lack of pulsatile inertial effects in our model (see \ref{sec:dispersion_details}). In this scenario, we observe a pressure drop of $8.5\,$Pa between lateral ventricles and the spinal SAS and a maximum flow velocity of $0.29\,$m/s at the craniocervical junction.
Next, we estimate a spatially varying dispersion enhancement factor $R$ from cardiac-induced pulsatility by combining the computed pressure field with the theory of shear-augmented dispersion (see \Cref{sec:dispersion_details}). We find that cardiac-induced pulsatile CSF flow increases the effective diffusion by up to two orders of magnitude in the aqueduct and around the cisterna magna, but has little effect in most of the SAS ($R < 1$) (\Cref{fig:csf}). 

% respiratory pulsatility
Employing the same methodology, we estimate the respiratory contribution to dispersive mixing by computing the CSF flow field driven by an inflow of $0.121\,$ml/s \cite{liu2024using} and $0.879\,$ml/s across the lateral ventricular wall and the arachnoid mater, respectively. This amounts to a respiratory peak flow volume of $1\,$ ml/s at the craniocervical junction \cite{gutierrez2022effect}. While the resulting flow velocities are about one order of magnitude lower than their cardiac-induced counterparts (see \Cref{fig:csf_flow_respiratory}), respiratory dispersive mixing reaches a factor of up to 80 due the lower respiratory frequency ($0.25\,$Hz) (\Cref{fig:csf_flow_R_respiratory}).


% tracer trajectory of the standard model


% tracer trajectory of model variations

\begin{itemize}
    \item only dispersion model: No production flow. Tracer remains in the subtentorial regions, in cerebellum, brain stem and surrounding CSF. In contrast to other models, it travels up the ventricular system - similar to what is observed in iNPH patients?
    \item Low dispersion model: account for uncertainty (or pathologies with impaired pulsatile motion?) - tracer exclusively spreads in the frontal half of the brain.
    \item

\subsection*{Structural versus functional compartmentalization of perivascular spaces}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Are perivascular spaces functionally or structurally
  compartmentalized? Human and rodent observations indicate that
  tracers concentrate in perivascular spaces surrounding the pial and
  subarachnoid vasculature. Must these spaces be structural
  i.e.~defined by semi-permeable structural
  membrane~\cite{zhang1990interrelationships, zhang1992directional,
    mestre2018flow, eide2024functional}, or can such
  compartmentalization be a result of regions of enhanced flow or
  mixing~\cite{bedussi2017paravascular, vinje2021brain}? See also
  references in Background.

\subsection*{The significance of low-resistance perivascular pathways}

\mer{MER: Remember to report on how much concentration enters into the brain?}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Perivascular flow and transport has been identified as a key
  mechanism and potential target for enhancing brain drug delivery and
  metabolic waste clearance -- what are the global (intracranial)
  effects of such intracranial highways? 
\item
  Compare Model A and B (\Cref{tab:scenarios}).
\item
  Do solutes move from PVS to the SAS, or both along the PVS and along the SAS?
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Clearance and the brain's waterscape}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
  Modelling metabolite clearance rather than solute influx (Model
  C). Consider several diffusion coefficients corresponding to
  gadubutrol, dextran, tau and amyloid-beta, otherwise identical flow
  set-ups.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Intracranial solute influx and clearance during sleep}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Sleep is known to affect a number of the transport characteristics including: increased extracellular volume fraction, altered vascular pulsatility and a-forteriori perivascular flow and mixing, reduced CSF production, reduced glymphatic transport.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Influx and clearance in pathologies}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  A number of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders yield mechanical changes in the intracranial environment (increased arterial stiffness, cerebral arterial angiopathies, perivascular flow changes due to hypertension, altered CSF flow patterns, altered diffusion properties in cancer, BBB leakage). One key clinical aspect is increased PVS width in e.g. iNPH.

No leak to vasculature (zero permeability). $\infty$ $\zeta_0$ at the PVS-SAS interface, $\zeta_1$ at the PVS-SAS interface.

\section*{Methods}

%\mer{MER: I recommend writing each (sub)section of Methods as a nearly stand-alone paragraph. Let's see if we can avoid subsubsections/paragraphs. If you need to add more detail than you think is appropriate, put it in a Supplementary Methods section in the Appendix.} 

\subsection*{Intracranial compartments: ventricular system, SAS, and brain parenchyma}

From T1-weighted MR images of a human subject~\cite{hodneland2019new},
we first automatically segment the brain parenchyma and CSF spaces,
including the ventricular system and SAS, using
Synthseg~\cite{billot2023robust,billot2023synthseg}. We next manually
adjust the segmentation to accurately represent the connections
between CSF spaces (aqueduct, median aperture), smoothen, and finally
extract surface representations of the outer (arachnoid) boundary, the
pial membrane and other interfaces. Conforming to these surface and
interface representations, we generate a tetrahedral mesh $\Omega$
representing the complete intracranial volume as the union of the
parenchyma $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ and CSF spaces $\Omega_{\rm CSF}$, using
fTetWild~\cite{hu2020fast}. The resulting computational mesh consists
of $153\,729$ vertices and $851\,904$ mesh cells, which vary between
$0.4$ mm and $1.2$ cm in mesh cell diameter. The parenchyma has a
total volume of $1386$ ml, whereas the ventricles and the outer SAS
contribute $28$ ml and $277$ ml, respectively, to a total CSF volume
of $305$ml, in agreement with recent
estimates~\cite{hladky2024regulation}.

%% In addition, we slightly modify the segmentation to ensure correct
%% connectivity of the ventricular system. In particular, we elongate
%% the aqueduct and enforce no communication between the ventricles
%% and the surrounding CSF spaces except for the median aperture.
%% After morphological smoothing of the segmented image, we extract
%% surface representations of the outer SAS boundary, the pial
%% membrane and the components of the ventricular system.

%% Note that the widely reported value of $150$\,ml of intracranial
%% CSF volume is likely an underestimate. Recent estimates indicate
%% that a value of $200$ to $300$\,ml is more accurate (see
%% \cite{hladky2024regulation} and references therein

\subsection*{Periarterial and perivenous spaces}

To represent surface networks of periarterial and perivenous spaces,
we use Kiminaro~\cite{william_silversmith_2021_5539913} to separately
skeletonize time-of-flight angiography (ToF) and quantitative
susceptibility mapping (QSM) images from the same human
subject~\cite{hodneland2019new}. This technique yields networks of
one-dimensional curves, each curve $\Lambda^i$ indicating the
centerline of a blood vessel segment and labeled with its lumen radius
$R_1^i$. We also assign an outer radius $R_2^i > R_1^i$ to each
segment $i$, form the annular cylinder ensheathing $\Lambda^i$ and
define the union of these as the PVS. The periarterial network graph
consists of $12\,708$ edges connected at $12\,562$ inner nodes and
with $147$ end nodes, and the associated domain is denoted by
$\Lambda_a$. We identify three of the end nodes -- corresponding to
the two internal carotid arteries (ICAs) and the basilar artery (BA)
-- as root nodes, and designate the other ends as leaf nodes. The
resulting perivenous network graph consists of $\fixme{N}$ edges
connected at $\fixme{N}$ inner nodes and with $\fixme{N}$ end nodes,
and the associated domain is denoted by $\Lambda_v$. \fixme{Finally, we label
the outer surface of the PVS associated with $\Lambda_a$ and
$\Lambda_v$, by $\Gamma_a$ and $\Gamma_v$ respectively.}

%% The resulting vascular networks are further smoothened using a
%% spline interpolation technique, and represented as graphs with
%% nodes connected by edges.

\subsection*{Molecular transport equations}

We model diffusion, convection, and exchange of a molecular solute in
the PVS networks $\Lambda_a$ and $\Lambda_v$, in the CSF spaces
$\Omega_{\rm CSF}$ and in the brain parenchyma $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ via
a mixed-dimensional transport model~\cite{masri2023modelling} over a
timescale of minutes to hours. Specifically, for $t > 0$, we solve for
a concentration $c = c(x, t)$ in the 3D intracranial compartments ($x
\in \Omega_{\rm CSF}, x \in \Omega_{\rm PAR}$) and for a cross-section
averaged concentration $\hat{c} = \hat{c}(s, t)$ in the periarterial
and perivenous networks ($s \in \Lambda_a, s \in \Lambda_v$) such that
the following equations hold:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
  \partial_t (\phi c) - \nabla \cdot (D \nabla (\phi c) ) + \nabla \cdot (\bm u c ) + \xi (\overline{c} - \hat c ) \delta_\Gamma & = 0 && \quad \quad \mathrm{in} \quad \Omega_{\rm CSF}, \Omega_{\rm{PAR}},
  \label{eq:multi_transport_3d}
  \\ 
  \partial_t (A  \hat c) - \partial_s(\hat D A \partial_s ( \hat c)) +\partial_s(A \hat u \hat c )  +  \xi P (\hat c - \overline{c})  &= 0 && \quad \quad \mathrm{in} \quad  \Lambda_a, \Lambda_v .
  \label{eq:multi_transport_1d}
 \end{alignat}%
\label{eq:multi_transport}%
\end{subequations}%
In~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}, $0 < \phi \leqslant 1$ is the fluid
volume fraction, $D$ and $\hat{D}$ are effective diffusion
coefficients, and $\bm u$ and $\hat{u}$ are fluid (CSF/ISF)
velocities, all defined in the respective compartments; $P = 2 \pi
R_2$ is the perimeter and $A = \pi (R_2^2 - R_1^2)$ the area of the
PVS cross-sections, $\delta_{\Gamma}$ is the Dirac delta function
concentrated on the interfaces $\Gamma_a, \Gamma_v$, the overlined
$\overline{c}$ denotes the average of $c$ over cross-sections of
$\Gamma_a, \Gamma_v$, and $\xi$ is a permeability allowing for
transfer/exchange over the interfaces $\Gamma_a, \Gamma_v$ between the
periarterial and perivenous networks and their surroundings.
Moreover, we model the membrane between the parenchyma and the CSF
spaces as a semi-permeable membrane with permeability cofficient
$\beta_{\rm pia}$. For a complete description of this mathematical
model, see \Cref{sec:more_maths}.

\subsection*{Intracranial influx after intrathecal injection}
To represent molecular influx into the intracranial compartments
following intrathecal injection, without modelling the spinal
compartment explicitly, we prescribe a time-dependent molecular influx
over the interface towards the spinal compartment with the condition
$(D \nabla c - \bm u c ) \cdot \bm{n} = g_{\mathrm{influx}}$ on
$\Gamma_{\mathrm{SSAS}}$. We set
\begin{equation}
  g_\mathrm{influx}(t) = \frac{m_{\rm tot}}{T_{\rm max}^2 |\Gamma_{\rm SSAS}|} \max(0, T_{\rm max} - |t - T_{\rm max}|)
\end{equation}
which expresses a hat-shaped influx function with a peak at $T_{\rm max}$ and a total tracer injection of $m_{\rm tot}$ (\Cref{tab:parameters}).

\subsection*{Molecular clearance from the intracranial space and perivascular network ends}
%\subsection*{Boundary conditions: extracranial efflux and perivascular parenchymal influx}

We model molecular clearance, into the meningeal lymphatics or other
pathways, across the upper, outer (arachnoid) boundary
(\Cref{fig:intracranial_domains}), proportional to the concentration
in the SAS with a rate constant $\beta_{\rm exit}$. We set a no-flux
condition at the end nodes of the perivascular networks, not allowing
for direct molecular clearance there.

\subsection*{CSF flow in the SAS and ventricular system}
\label{sec:csf_fluid_vel}

We model CSF as an incompressible Newtonian fluid at low Reynolds and
Womersley numbers via the Stokes equations with viscosity $\mu$, and
account for the convective contribution of the flow induced by CSF
production in the choroid plexus. Specifically, we compute the
velocity $\bm u_{\rm CSF}$ and associated pressure $p_{\rm CSF}$ in
the SAS and ventricular system induced by a constant production at a
rate of $u_{\rm in}$ across the lateral ventricle walls and with
efflux across the upper, outer (arachnoid) boundary with efflux
resistance $R_0$; and then set $\bm u = \bm u_{\rm CSF}$ in
$\Omega_{\rm CSF}$ in~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}
(\Cref{tab:parameters}, \Cref{fig:intracranial_domains},
\Cref{fig:csf_flow_prod}, see also \Cref{sec:more_maths}). We do not
directly model convection within the brain tissue (beyond the
perivascular spaces), and thus set $\bm u = 0$ in $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$
in~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}.

\subsection*{Dispersion in the CSF spaces}

The pulsatile flow of CSF in the SAS and ventricular system,
associated with the cardiac and respiratory cycles, substantially
enhances molecular diffusion through
dispersion~\cite{taylor1953dispersion, watson1983diffusion,
  asgari2016glymphatic, keith2019dispersion, ray2021quantitative,
  troyetsky2021dispersion}. To account for these dispersive effects,
we compute a spatially-varying dispersion factor $R$ in $\Omega_{\rm
  CSF}$ (\Cref{fig:csf_flow_R}) by combining a computational model of
the CSF pressure gradient at peak arterial dilation with theoretical
estimates for shear-augmented (Taylor) dispersion
\cite{taylor1953dispersion, watson1983diffusion, keith2019dispersion}. \mer{Include 1-2 sentences from Supplementary Methods here -- but which? And also revisit references with MC.}

\mer{MER: Stopped here. WIP in Supplementary Methods.}

\subsection*{Dispersion in the PVS}

Similar to the CSF spaces, dispersion due to cardiac and respiratory pulsation has been hypothesized to enhance transport in the perivascular spaces. However, recent estimates indicate that the effect of dispersion does not exceed a factor of 2 compared to diffusion alone \cite{asgari2016glymphatic,keith2019dispersion,bojarskaite2023sleep,asgari2016glymphatic,troyetsky2021dispersion}, and we thus do not model dispersive effects in the PVS. 
\mar{Maybe we should just take a factor of 2 as the upper bound?}

% \cite{keith2019dispersion}: dispersion in PVS is negligiable in porous PVS, but might be relevant in open PVS (R=220) (theoretical estimates)
%  \cite{bojarskaite2023sleep} numerical simulations show that the enhancement factor is likely in the range of 10 - 50 \%
%\cite{asgari2016glymphatic} numerical simulations show increase of 16% to 50%  in distribution lengths
%\cite{troyetsky2021dispersion}:   maximum enhancement of diffusion of only about 5%




\subsection*{Perivascular fluid flow induced by CSF pressure differences}

Since the pressure gradient the caused by the steady production-driven CSF flow (see \cref{sec:csf_fluid_vel}), we impose the precomputed fluid pressure $p_{\rm CSF}$ on the networks root nodes:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{p} = p_{\rm CSF} \quad \text{ on } \Lambda^{\rm out}
\end{equation}
In case that the root does not lie within the CSF-space but the parenchyma, the CSF pressure is not yet computed. For that reason, we apply a simple extension technique to map the CSF pressure field into $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$. In particular, we solve a Laplace equation on $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ with the CSF pressure on the Pial membrane ($\Gamma_{\rm Pia}$) as a boundary condition.


\subsection*{Perivascular fluid flow induced by vascular wall motion}

Using the theoretical framework introduced by Gjerde et
al.~\cite{gjerde2023directional}, we compute analytic estimates for
the time-average perivascular flow rate $\langle Q' \rangle$ induced
by rhythmic vascular wall motions for different frequencies $f$,
amplitudes $\varepsilon$ and wave lengths $\lambda$ in the arterial
network $\Lambda^a$ (see also Supplementary
Methods~\ref{sec:sup:peristalsis}). The corresponding contribution to
the convective velocity $\hat{u}_{\rm x}$ is defined vessel-wise as
$\hat{u}_{\rm x}|_{\Lambda_i} = \langle Q'_i \rangle/A_i$ where $A_i$
is the cross-section area of the PVS segment ($A_i = \pi (R_2^i -
R_1^i$)) and $\langle Q_i' \rangle$ is its mean flow rate. Two wall
motion patterns are considered: \emph{cardiac} pulsations with $f =
1.0$ (Hz), $\lambda = 2000$ (mm) and $\varepsilon = 1\%$, and very
low-frequency \emph{vasomotion} with $f = 0.1$ (Hz), $\lambda = 20$
(mm), and $\varepsilon = 10\%$. \mer{The corresponding net convective
velocities (in the antegrade direction) are for \emph{vasomotion}:
$9.345 \pm 6.695$ $\mu$m/s, range: $(-65.81, 63.96) \mu$m/s, and for
\emph{cardiac}: $0.475 \pm 0.5115 \mu$m/s, range: $(- 3.825, 4.861)
\mu$m/s, where negative velocities correspond to retrograde flow
(\Cref{fig:pvs}\mer{X}).} No perivascular fluid flow induced by wall
motion is considered for the venous network.


\subsection*{Model and material parameters}

Model and material parameters are summarized in \Cref{tab:parameters}.
We assume that the porosity equals the extracellular space volume
fraction $\phi = \phi_{\rm PAR}$ within the parenchyma and $\phi = 1$
elsewhere. In influx scenarios, we model the concentration of
Gadubutrol with effective diffusion coefficient equal to that of
Gadubutrol in free water in the PVS networks: $\hat{D} = D^{\rm Gad}$;
weighted by a dispersion factor $R$ in the CSF spaces:
$D|_{\Omega_{\rm CSF}} = ( 1 + R) D^{\rm Gad}$; and modulated by the
porosity and tortuousity ($\lambda = 1.78$) in the parenchyma:
$D|_{\Omega_{\rm PAR}} = D^{\rm Gad}_{\rm PAR}$. We set $\xi$
depending on whether the PVS segment is fully embedded within the CSF
spaces ($\xi = \xi_{\rm CSF}$) or parenchyma ($\xi = \xi_{\rm EF}$),
or neither (\Cref{sec:more_maths}). Additionally, we increase the
permeability $\xi$ ($100\times$) near the leaf nodes of $\Lambda_a$ to
account for the transition from explicitly resolved PVSs to their
unresolved continuation in the CSF spaces and parenchyma.

\subsection*{Initial conditions}

We set the initial concentrations $c_0, \hat{c}_0$ in the
three-dimensional domain $\Omega$ and networks $\Lambda_a, \Lambda_v$
to be zero for all influx scenarios. For parenchymal
clearance scenarios, we set $c_0 = 1, \hat{c}_0 = 0$.

\subsection*{Numerical approximation of multi-dimensional transport and CSF flow}

\mer{@Rami: Could you draft one paragraph here describing the essential bits of the numerical scheme? I recommend ``describing with words'' to reach relevant audiences. Refer to the Supplementary Methods for details. Mention theoretical expected convergence order.} 

In this section, we provide a brief overview on the employed numerical discretization. We refer to \Cref{sec:details_numerical_method} for details. The numerical scheme for the CSF flow equations utilizes polynomial spaces that preserve the divergence free condition \eqref{eq:divergence_equation} on the discrete level \cite{hong2016robust}. This requirement is important for stability in the transport equation, see for example \cite{cesmelioglu2022compatible}. The spaces we used for the velocity are continuous along the normal direction; continuity of the tangential component is enforced via interior penalty approaches \cite{hong2016robust}.  If the exact solution of \eqref{eq:momnetum_equation}--\eqref{eq:divergence_equation} is smooth, then one expects optimal error convergence rates for this approximation. 

For the 3D transport problem, we use the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with weighted averages and upwinding for the convection term \cite{ern2009discontinuous}.  We remark that the choice of DG in the 3D domain is necessary here since  continuous Galerkin methods even when supplemented with artificial diffusion stabilization terms were unstable in our experiments. For the 1D transport problem, we use continuous Galerkin spaces defined over the entire network with additional artificial diffusion silization when the 1D velocity is non--zero.  DG methods for the coupled 3D--1D problem have been recently analyzed  where convergence of the method for the elliptic case is established \cite{masri2024discontinuous}. While the analysis is for DG methods for both the 3D and the 1D problem, we expect similar arguments to hold here. However, note that the 3D--1D coupling induces a singularity in the 3D solution and one can only expect suboptimal error rates near the 1D network. In subdomains excluding the 1D lines, almost optimal rates can be expected for both DG methods \cite{masri2023discontinuous} and CG methods \cite{koppl2016local}.  Extension of the convergence analysis to convection--diffusion problems is an interesting future research direction.

  \caption{Overview of models (-- denotes as immediately above). Each
    PVS cross-section is modelled as a concentric annulus with inner
    radius $R_1$ and outer radius $R_2$ and such that $R_2 = \beta
    R_1$ with $\beta = 2.0$ based on~\cite{eide2024functional}. Let
    $\xi = \dots$ denote the permeability estimated by Koch et
    al.~\cite{koch2023estimates}. Model A and its variations aims to
    quantify the effect of PVS sheaths by varying the permeability
    $\xi$ between the PVS and its surroundings. We consider a fixed
    permeability $\xi_{\rm PVS-PAR}$ based
    on~\cite{koch2023estimates}. \mer{The permeability between the PVS
      and the SAS $\xi_{\rm PVS-SAS}$ must likely be estimated by a
      bit of trial-error from the observations of timings of PVS-SAS
      and SAS from~\cite{eide2024functional}.} \discuss{The
      extracranial solute efflux permeability $\beta_{\rm efflux}$ is
      uniformly distributed over the outer SAS boundary with a
      reasonable rate as baseline\cite{hornkjol2022csf,
        eide2021clinical, ringstad2024glymphatic}.} At baseline, the
    effective diffusion coefficients $D^{\rm x}_{\rm SAS} = D^{\rm
      x}_{\rm PVS}$ of the SAS and PVS represent the free diffusion
    coefficient of Gadubutrol (${\rm x} = {\rm gad}$) in CSF (water),
    and $D^{\rm x}_{\rm PAR}$ the effective diffusion coefficient of
    human cortical tissue, all at body temperature; weighted by a
    dispersion factor $\alpha$ (see Methods). At baseline, we consider
    net flow due to CSF-production in the SAS and PVS:
    $\mathbf{u}_{\rm SAS} > 0$ and $\hat{u} > 0$ (see Methods) but no
    bulk flow in the parenchyma $\mathbf{u}_{\rm PAR} = 0$. Due to the
    timescale for human intracranial tracer transport (minutes to
    hours) compared to typical (cardiac, respiratory, slow vasomotion)
    human intracranial pulsatility (0.1 -- 1 Hz), we consider net
    (constant-in-time) flow fields only in subsequent model variations
    (but see dispersion factor above).  Model B represents
    perivascular pathway scenarios with more rapid flow in the PVS
    induced by vasomotion (PVS I)~\cite{gjerde2023directional}.
    Models C represents a version of the aforementioned scenarios but
    for studying metabolite clearance (instead of solute influx).}

\mer{To be edited, just moved here:} We will consider different values for the SAS-PVS permeability $\xi$, including $\xi = 0$ (sealed PVS), $\xi \approx \infty$ (PVS continuous with SAS), as well as reasonable intermediate values. We will ignore PVS-blood exchange, and thus only model the perivascular concentration at the network level (in addition to the SAS/brain concentration in the surroundings).

\section*{Discussion}

\paragraph{CSF flow Model validation}

Hornkjøl et al \cite{hornkjol2022csf} model CSF flow induced by production in the choroid plexus and report a peak velocity of $8.9\,$mm/s in the aqueduct. Given that similar flow rates were enforced, the deviation from our value of $2.0\,$mm/s is likely due to differences in diameter of the reconstructed aqueduct. Additionally, their peak velocities in the SAS range between 20 - 50 $\mu\,$m/s, which is compatible with our mean velocity of $4.4\,\mu$m/s (\Cref{fig:csf_flow_histo}).

The aqueductal ($0.31\,$ml/s) and craniocervical ($8.31\,$ml/s) flow rates predicted by our model align well with previously reported values of $0.31\,$ml/s peak aqueductal flow rate \cite{vinje2019respiratory} and about $9\,$ml/s peak net blood inflow into the cranium \cite{baledent2014imaging}. Further, Linninger et al \cite{linninger2007cerebrospinal} model cardiac-induced CSF flow and predict a maximum transmantle pressure difference of $10\,$Pa, which is in good agreement with our estimate of $8.5\,$Pa as well as clinically measured mean pressure differences of $11.5\,$Pa between sensors placed subdurally and in the lateral ventricle \cite{vinje2019respiratory}.
% 10.7 cm/s CSF flow at the craniovertebral junction in control \cite{bapuraj2016cerebrospinal}, area difference?

Sharp et al used the theory of dispersive mixing to predict a dispersion enhancement factor of $91.8$ in the (open) spinal SAS, which lies well within the range of our spatially varying estimate (ranging from 0 to 160). Conversely, \cite{ray2021quantitative} report up to 10,000 times greater diffusion in perivascular regions, but their modelling lumps diffusive, dispersive and advective transport in a single enhancement factor and is thus not directly comparable.



\subsection*{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \mer{MER/MC: How about dispersion in the PVS?}
\item 
  Inaccuracies in vascular geometry representation - and consequences downstream for e.g. numerical integration.
\item
  PVS geometry assumptions and approximations. Humans different from mice. Limitations in resolution.
\item
  No vasculature in the cerebellum, and of course no vasculature below certain resolution.
\item
  Only partially accounting for pulsatility. Ignoring respiration frequencies - dubious in the context of CSF flow.
\item
  Accounting for brain diffusive anisotropy. Little effect expected. Maybe something to consider in small follow-up work.
\item
  Permeability and stiffness of the pial membrane
\item
  PVS-blood exchange and BBB leakage. Natural to consider in model variation here, or follow-up work.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Outlook}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Considering the (maybe) low diffusion in CSF spaces, maybe pure
  advection would be relevant? Both computational and physiological
  implications/interest.
\end{itemize}
