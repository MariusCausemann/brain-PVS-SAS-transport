\section*{Introduction}

Molecular transport in perivascular spaces (PVSs) is established as a key pathway for human brain clearance and delivery. Previous studies indicate that molecules move rapidly in the subarachnoid space (SAS) and in PVSs surrounding pial arteries. Here, we aim to model and study this transport in a full pial perivascular and/or vascular network embedded in the SAS.  

Motivation: as indicated by~\cite{iliff2012paravascular}, referring to
Cserr, Phys Rev., 1971, bulk convective flow may be more important for
larger species (larger distances) and larger molecules.

\subsection*{CSF flow and dispersion shifts enrichment patterns}

Flow of CSF through the SAS and the ventricular system is a crucial driver of transport in the human brain environment.
While cardiac- and respiratory induced oscillatory flow increases mixing, the production of CSF in the choroid plexus creates a steady advective flow within the CSF-filled spaces of the cranium \cite{hornkjol2022csf}. 
We construct a 3D model of the SAS and the ventricular system (\Cref{fig:csf}A,B and C) and compute CSF flow fields for three different scenarios: CSF production in the choroid plexus, CSF flow at systolic peak blood inflow and CSF flow in response to free breathing.

% production flow simulation
To simulate the production-driven flow, we impose an inflow of $400\,$ml/day \cite{nilsson1992circadian} across the surface of the lateral ventricle and allow a resistive outflow across the upper convexity of the arachnoid mater, leading to a total pressure drop of $26\,$mPa between the production and outflow sites (\Cref{fig:csf}D). A maximum flow velocity of $1.8\,$mm/s is attained in the aqueduct, while the mean velocity in the SAS is $2.6\,\mu$m/s (\Cref{fig:csf} E).

%The Stokes system is solved with the finite element software $FEniCS$, stored and then subsequently read for all the relevant solute transport simulations. See Figure~\ref{fig:csf} for a streamline visualization of the obtained velocity profile and \Cref{sec:details_numerical_method} for details on the numerical algorithm employed.

% cardiac pulsatility
Assessing the effect of cardiac-driven dispersion, we compute a steady CSF flow field at peak systolic blood inflow. We mimic the resulting reduction of CSF space volume by imposing an inflow of $6\,$ml/s \cite{baledent2014imaging, causemann2022human} and $0.31\,$ml/s \cite{vinje2019respiratory} across the upper arachnoid mater ($\Gamma_{\rm AM-U}$) and the lateral ventricle ($\Gamma_{\rm VL}$) surface, respectively. We allow free outflow into the spinal SAS ($\Gamma_{\rm SSAS}$). In addition, we upscale the obtained pressure field to account for the lack of pulsatile inertial effects in our model (see \ref{sec:dispersion_details}). In this scenario, we observe a pressure drop of $10\,$Pa between lateral ventricles and the spinal SAS and a maximum flow velocity of $19.8\,$cm/s in the aqueduct (\Cref{fig:csf}F and J).
Next, we estimate a spatially varying dispersion enhancement factor $R$ from cardiac-induced pulsatility by combining the computed pressure field with the theory of shear-augmented dispersion (see \Cref{sec:dispersion_details}). Assuming a cardiac frequency of $1\,$Hz, find that cardiac-induced pulsatile CSF flow increases the effective diffusion by up to two orders of magnitude in the aqueduct and around the cisterna magna, but has little effect in most of the SAS ($R < 1$) (\Cref{fig:csf} G and K). 

% respiratory pulsatility
Employing the same methodology, we estimate the respiratory contribution to dispersive mixing by computing the CSF flow field driven by an inflow of $0.121\,$ml/s \cite{liu2024using} and $1\,$ml/s across the lateral ventricular wall and the arachnoid mater, respectively. This amounts to a respiratory peak flow volume of $1.121\,$ ml/s at the craniocervical junction \cite{gutierrez2022effect}. While the resulting flow velocities are only about one fourth of their cardiac-induced counterparts (see \Cref{fig:csf}H and L), respiratory dispersive mixing reaches a factor of up to 350 due the lower respiratory frequency ($0.25\,$Hz) (\Cref{fig:csf}I and M).


% tracer trajectory of the standard model
Next, we use the computed advective velcity field and dispersion enhancement factors to predict the spreading of $0.5\,$mmol intrathecally injected Gadobutrol in CSF-filled spaces, the parenchymal tissue and PVSs around arteries and veines. One hour post-injection, tracer moves upwards in the SAS frontally of the brainstem,  and quickly reaches supratentorial regions (\Cref{fig:csf}N). Here, it spreads both posteriorly through the longitudinal fissure and anteriorly through the outer SAS, reaching the top of the cerebral cortex after around 12 h. After 24h, the tracer covers most of the brains surface (with exception of some posterior regions) and has penetrated several centimeters into the parenchymal tissue.

% tracer trajectory of model variations



\begin{itemize}
    \item only dispersion model: No production flow. Tracer remains in the subtentorial regions, in cerebellum, brain stem and surrounding CSF. In contrast to other models, it travels up the ventricular system - similar to what is observed in iNPH patients?
    \item Low dispersion model: account for uncertainty (or pathologies with impaired pulsatile motion?) - tracer exclusively spreads in the frontal half of the brain. Bifurcation of CSF production flow field: flow bifurcates around the midbrain in two directions: a) through the quadrigeminal cistern into the longitudinal fissure and b) frontally around the brain through the outer SAS. Only models with "enough" dispersion enable tracer to follow trajectory a).
    \item without tentorium:

\subsection*{The significance of perivascular spaces as flow highways}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Perivascular flow and transport has been identified as a key
  mechanism and potential target for enhancing brain drug delivery and
  metabolic waste clearance -- what are the global (intracranial)
  effects of such intracranial highways? 
\item
  Do solutes move from PVS to the SAS, or both along the PVS and along
  the SAS?

\subsection*{Structural versus functional compartmentalization of perivascular spaces}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Are perivascular spaces functionally or structurally
compartmentalized? Human and rodent observations indicate that tracers
concentrate in perivascular spaces surrounding the pial and
subarachnoid vasculature. Must these spaces be structural i.e.~defined
by semi-permeable structural
membrane~\cite{zhang1990interrelationships, zhang1992directional,
  mestre2018flow, eide2024functional}, or can such
compartmentalization be a result of regions of enhanced flow or
mixing~\cite{bedussi2017paravascular, vinje2021brain}? See also
references in Background.
\item
  Vary the PVS permeability $\xi$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Enlarged perivascular spaces yield ...}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Take $R_2 = 3 R_1$ instead of $2 R_1$.

\subsection*{The perivenous contribution to molecular clearance of CSF tracers}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Look at clearance phase 12h-24h-48h-72h.
\item
  Look at concentration in the veins
\item
  Look at concentration in the parenchyma
\item
  Consider low-pressure sink for the perivenous spaces.

\section*{Discussion}

\paragraph{CSF flow model validation}

Hornkjøl et al \cite{hornkjol2022csf} model CSF flow induced by production in the choroid plexus and report a peak velocity of $8.9\,$mm/s in the aqueduct. Given that similar flow rates were enforced, the deviation from our value of $2.0\,$mm/s is likely due to differences in diameter of the reconstructed aqueduct. Additionally, their peak velocities in the SAS range between 20 - 50 $\mu\,$m/s, which is compatible with our mean velocity of $4.4\,\mu$m/s (\Cref{fig:csf_flow_histo}).

The aqueductal ($0.31\,$ml/s) and craniocervical ($8.31\,$ml/s) flow rates predicted by our model align well with previously reported values of $0.31\,$ml/s peak aqueductal flow rate \cite{vinje2019respiratory} and about $9\,$ml/s peak net blood inflow into the cranium \cite{baledent2014imaging}. Further, Linninger et al \cite{linninger2007cerebrospinal} model cardiac-induced CSF flow and predict a maximum transmantle pressure difference of $10\,$Pa, which is in good agreement with our estimate of $8.5\,$Pa as well as clinically measured mean pressure differences of $11.5\,$Pa between sensors placed subdurally and in the lateral ventricle \cite{vinje2019respiratory}.
% 10.7 cm/s CSF flow at the craniovertebral junction in control \cite{bapuraj2016cerebrospinal}, area difference?

Sharp et al used the theory of dispersive mixing to predict a dispersion enhancement factor of $91.8$ in the (open) spinal SAS, which lies well within the range of our spatially varying estimate (ranging from 0 to 160). Conversely, \cite{ray2021quantitative} report up to 10,000 times greater diffusion in perivascular regions, but their modelling lumps diffusive, dispersive and advective transport in a single enhancement factor and is thus not directly comparable.



\subsection*{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \mer{MER/MC: How about dispersion in the PVS?}
\item 
  Inaccuracies in vascular geometry representation - and consequences downstream for e.g. numerical integration.
\item
  PVS geometry assumptions and approximations. Humans different from mice. Limitations in resolution.
\item
  No vasculature in the cerebellum, and of course no vasculature below certain resolution.
\item
  Only partially accounting for pulsatility. 
\item
  Accounting for brain diffusive anisotropy. Little effect expected. Maybe something to consider in small follow-up work.
\item
  Permeability and stiffness of the pial membrane
\item
  PVS-blood exchange and BBB leakage. Natural to consider in model variation here, or follow-up work. We here ignore PVS-blood exchange, and thus only model the perivascular concentration at the network level (in addition to the SAS/brain concentration in the surroundings).

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Outlook}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Considering the (maybe) low diffusion in CSF spaces, maybe pure
  advection would be relevant? Both computational and physiological
  implications/interest.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Methods}

%\mer{MER: I recommend writing each (sub)section of Methods as a nearly stand-alone paragraph. Let's see if we can avoid subsubsections/paragraphs. If you need to add more detail than you think is appropriate, put it in a Supplementary Methods section in the Appendix.} 

\subsection*{Intracranial compartments: ventricular system, SAS, and brain parenchyma}

From T1-weighted MR images of a human subject~\cite{hodneland2019new},
we first automatically segment the brain parenchyma and CSF spaces,
including the ventricular system and SAS, using
Synthseg~\cite{billot2023robust,billot2023synthseg}. We next manually
adjust the segmentation to accurately represent the connections
between CSF spaces (aqueduct, median aperture), smoothen, and finally
extract surface representations of the outer (arachnoid) boundary, the
pial membrane and other interfaces. Conforming to these surface and
interface representations, we generate a tetrahedral mesh $\Omega$
representing the complete intracranial volume as the union of the
parenchyma $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ and CSF spaces $\Omega_{\rm CSF}$, using
fTetWild~\cite{hu2020fast}. The resulting computational mesh consists
of $153\,729$ vertices and $851\,904$ mesh cells, which vary between
$0.4$ mm and $1.2$ cm in mesh cell diameter. The parenchyma has a
total volume of $1386$ ml, whereas the ventricles and the outer SAS
contribute $28$ ml and $277$ ml, respectively, to a total CSF volume
of $305$ml, in agreement with recent
estimates~\cite{hladky2024regulation}.

%% In addition, we slightly modify the segmentation to ensure correct
%% connectivity of the ventricular system. In particular, we elongate
%% the aqueduct and enforce no communication between the ventricles
%% and the surrounding CSF spaces except for the median aperture.
%% After morphological smoothing of the segmented image, we extract
%% surface representations of the outer SAS boundary, the pial
%% membrane and the components of the ventricular system.

%% Note that the widely reported value of $150$\,ml of intracranial
%% CSF volume is likely an underestimate. Recent estimates indicate
%% that a value of $200$ to $300$\,ml is more accurate (see
%% \cite{hladky2024regulation} and references therein

\subsection*{Periarterial and perivenous spaces}

To represent surface networks of periarterial and perivenous spaces,
we use Kiminaro~\cite{william_silversmith_2021_5539913} to separately
skeletonize time-of-flight angiography (ToF) and quantitative
susceptibility mapping (QSM) images from the same human
subject~\cite{hodneland2019new}. This technique yields networks of
one-dimensional curves, each curve $\Lambda^i$ indicating the
centerline of a blood vessel segment and labeled with its lumen radius
$R_1^i$. We also assign an outer radius $R_2^i > R_1^i$ to each
segment $i$, form the annular cylinder ensheathing $\Lambda^i$ and
define the union of these as the PVS. The periarterial network graph
consists of $12\,708$ edges connected at $12\,562$ inner nodes and
with $147$ end nodes, and the associated domain is denoted by
$\Lambda_a$. We identify three of the end nodes -- corresponding to
the two internal carotid arteries (ICAs) and the basilar artery (BA)
-- as root nodes, and designate the other ends as leaf nodes. The
resulting perivenous network graph consists of $\fixme{N}$ edges
connected at $\fixme{N}$ inner nodes and with $\fixme{N}$ end nodes,
and the associated domain is denoted by $\Lambda_v$. \fixme{Finally, we label
the outer surface of the PVS associated with $\Lambda_a$ and
$\Lambda_v$, by $\Gamma_a$ and $\Gamma_v$ respectively.}

%% The resulting vascular networks are further smoothened using a
%% spline interpolation technique, and represented as graphs with
%% nodes connected by edges.

\subsection*{Molecular transport equations}

We model diffusion, convection, and exchange of a molecular solute in
the PVS networks $\Lambda_a$ and $\Lambda_v$, in the CSF spaces
$\Omega_{\rm CSF}$ and in the brain parenchyma $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ via
a mixed-dimensional transport model~\cite{masri2023modelling} over a
timescale of minutes to hours. Specifically, for $t > 0$, we solve for
a concentration $c = c(x, t)$ in the 3D intracranial compartments ($x
\in \Omega_{\rm CSF}, x \in \Omega_{\rm PAR}$) and for a cross-section
averaged concentration $\hat{c} = \hat{c}(s, t)$ in the periarterial
and perivenous networks ($s \in \Lambda_a, s \in \Lambda_v$) such that
the following equations hold:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
  \partial_t (\phi c) - \nabla \cdot (D \nabla (\phi c) ) + \nabla \cdot (\bm u c ) + \xi (\overline{c} - \hat c ) \delta_\Gamma & = 0 && \quad \quad \mathrm{in} \quad \Omega_{\rm CSF}, \Omega_{\rm{PAR}},
  \label{eq:multi_transport_3d}
  \\ 
  \partial_t (A  \hat c) - \partial_s(\hat D A \partial_s ( \hat c)) +\partial_s(A \hat u \hat c )  +  \xi P (\hat c - \overline{c})  &= 0 && \quad \quad \mathrm{in} \quad  \Lambda_a, \Lambda_v .
  \label{eq:multi_transport_1d}
 \end{alignat}%
\label{eq:multi_transport}%
\end{subequations}%
In~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}, $0 < \phi \leqslant 1$ is the fluid
volume fraction, $D$ and $\hat{D}$ are effective diffusion
coefficients, and $\bm u$ and $\hat{u}$ are fluid (CSF/ISF)
velocities, all defined in the respective compartments; $P = 2 \pi
R_2$ is the perimeter and $A = \pi (R_2^2 - R_1^2)$ the area of the
PVS cross-sections, $\delta_{\Gamma}$ is the Dirac delta function
concentrated on the interfaces $\Gamma_a, \Gamma_v$, the overlined
$\overline{c}$ denotes the average of $c$ over cross-sections of
$\Gamma_a, \Gamma_v$, and $\xi$ is a permeability allowing for
transfer/exchange over the interfaces $\Gamma_a, \Gamma_v$ between the
periarterial and perivenous networks and their surroundings.
Moreover, we model the membrane between the parenchyma and the CSF
spaces as a semi-permeable membrane with permeability cofficient
$\beta_{\rm pia}$. For a complete description of this mathematical
model, see \Cref{sec:more_maths}.

\subsection*{Intracranial influx after intrathecal injection}
To represent molecular influx into the intracranial compartments
following intrathecal injection, without modelling the spinal
compartment explicitly, we prescribe a time-dependent molecular influx
over the interface towards the spinal compartment with the condition
$(D \nabla c - \bm u c ) \cdot \bm{n} = g_{\mathrm{influx}}$ on
$\Gamma_{\mathrm{SSAS}}$. We set
\begin{equation}
  g_\mathrm{influx}(t) = \frac{m_{\rm tot}}{T_{\rm max}^2 |\Gamma_{\rm SSAS}|} \max(0, T_{\rm max} - |t - T_{\rm max}|)
\end{equation}
which expresses a hat-shaped influx function with a peak at $T_{\rm max}$ and a total tracer injection of $m_{\rm tot}$ (\Cref{tab:parameters}).

\subsection*{Molecular clearance from the intracranial space and perivascular network ends}
%\subsection*{Boundary conditions: extracranial efflux and perivascular parenchymal influx}

We model molecular clearance, into the meningeal lymphatics or other
pathways, across the upper, outer (arachnoid) boundary
(\Cref{fig:intracranial_domains}), proportional to the concentration
in the SAS with a rate constant $\beta_{\rm exit}$. We set a no-flux
condition at the end nodes of the perivascular networks, not allowing
for direct molecular clearance there.

\subsection*{CSF flow in the SAS and ventricular system}
\label{sec:csf_fluid_vel}

We model CSF as an incompressible Newtonian fluid at low Reynolds and
Womersley numbers via the Stokes equations with viscosity $\mu$, and
account for the convective contribution of the flow induced by CSF
production in the choroid plexus. Specifically, we compute the
velocity $\bm u_{\rm CSF}$ and associated pressure $p_{\rm CSF}$ in
the SAS and ventricular system induced by a constant production at a
rate of $u_{\rm in}$ across the lateral ventricle walls and with
efflux across the upper, outer (arachnoid) boundary with efflux
resistance $R_0$; and then set $\bm u = \bm u_{\rm CSF}$ in
$\Omega_{\rm CSF}$ in~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}
(\Cref{tab:parameters}, \Cref{fig:intracranial_domains},
\Cref{fig:csf_flow_prod}, see also \Cref{sec:more_maths}). We do not
directly model convection within the brain tissue (beyond the
perivascular spaces), and thus set $\bm u = 0$ in $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$
in~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}.

\subsection*{Dispersion in the CSF spaces}

The pulsatile flow of CSF in the SAS and ventricular system,
associated with the cardiac and respiratory cycles, substantially
enhances molecular diffusion through
dispersion~\cite{taylor1953dispersion, watson1983diffusion,
  asgari2016glymphatic, keith2019dispersion, ray2021quantitative,
  troyetsky2021dispersion}. To account for these dispersive effects,
we compute a spatially-varying dispersion factor $R$ in $\Omega_{\rm
  CSF}$ (\Cref{fig:csf_flow_R}) by combining a computational model of
the CSF pressure gradient at peak arterial dilation with theoretical
estimates for shear-augmented (Taylor) dispersion
\cite{taylor1953dispersion, watson1983diffusion, keith2019dispersion}. \mer{Include 1-2 sentences from Supplementary Methods here -- but which? And also revisit references with MC.}

\mer{MER: Stopped here. WIP in Supplementary Methods.}

\subsection*{Dispersion in the PVS}

Similar to the CSF spaces, dispersion due to cardiac and respiratory pulsation has been hypothesized to enhance transport in the perivascular spaces. However, recent estimates indicate that the effect of dispersion does not exceed a factor of 2 compared to diffusion alone \cite{asgari2016glymphatic,keith2019dispersion,bojarskaite2023sleep,asgari2016glymphatic,troyetsky2021dispersion}, and we thus do not model dispersive effects in the PVS. 
\mar{Maybe we should just take a factor of 2 as the upper bound?}

% \cite{keith2019dispersion}: dispersion in PVS is negligiable in porous PVS, but might be relevant in open PVS (R=220) (theoretical estimates)
%  \cite{bojarskaite2023sleep} numerical simulations show that the enhancement factor is likely in the range of 10 - 50 \%
%\cite{asgari2016glymphatic} numerical simulations show increase of 16% to 50%  in distribution lengths
%\cite{troyetsky2021dispersion}:   maximum enhancement of diffusion of only about 5%


\subsection*{Perivascular fluid flow induced by CSF pressure differences}

Since the pressure gradient the caused by the steady production-driven CSF flow (see \cref{sec:csf_fluid_vel}), we impose the precomputed fluid pressure $p_{\rm CSF}$ on the networks root nodes:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{p} = p_{\rm CSF} \quad \text{ on } \Lambda^{\rm out}
\end{equation}
In case that the root does not lie within the CSF-space but the parenchyma, the CSF pressure is not yet computed. For that reason, we apply a simple extension technique to map the CSF pressure field into $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$. In particular, we solve a Laplace equation on $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ with the CSF pressure on the Pial membrane ($\Gamma_{\rm Pia}$) as a boundary condition.


\subsection*{Perivascular fluid flow induced by vascular wall motion}

Using the theoretical framework introduced by Gjerde et
al.~\cite{gjerde2023directional}, we compute analytic estimates for
the time-average perivascular flow rate $\langle Q' \rangle$ induced
by rhythmic vascular wall motions for different frequencies $f$,
amplitudes $\varepsilon$ and wave lengths $\lambda$ in the arterial
network $\Lambda^a$ (see also Supplementary
Methods~\ref{sec:sup:peristalsis}). The corresponding contribution to
the convective velocity $\hat{u}_{\rm x}$ is defined vessel-wise as
$\hat{u}_{\rm x}|_{\Lambda_i} = \langle Q'_i \rangle/A_i$ where $A_i$
is the cross-section area of the PVS segment ($A_i = \pi (R_2^i -
R_1^i$)) and $\langle Q_i' \rangle$ is its mean flow rate. Two wall
motion patterns are considered: \emph{cardiac} pulsations with $f =
1.0$ (Hz), $\lambda = 2000$ (mm) and $\varepsilon = 1\%$, and very
low-frequency \emph{vasomotion} with $f = 0.1$ (Hz), $\lambda = 20$
(mm), and $\varepsilon = 10\%$. \mer{The corresponding net convective
velocities (in the antegrade direction) are for \emph{vasomotion}:
$9.345 \pm 6.695$ $\mu$m/s, range: $(-65.81, 63.96) \mu$m/s, and for
\emph{cardiac}: $0.475 \pm 0.5115 \mu$m/s, range: $(- 3.825, 4.861)
\mu$m/s, where negative velocities correspond to retrograde flow
(\Cref{fig:pvs}\mer{X}).} No perivascular fluid flow induced by wall
motion is considered for the venous network.


\subsection*{Model and material parameters}

Model and material parameters are summarized in \Cref{tab:parameters}.
We assume that the porosity equals the extracellular space volume
fraction $\phi = \phi_{\rm PAR}$ within the parenchyma and $\phi = 1$
elsewhere. In influx scenarios, we model the concentration of
Gadubutrol with effective diffusion coefficient equal to that of
Gadubutrol in free water in the PVS networks: $\hat{D} = D^{\rm Gad}$;
weighted by a dispersion factor $R$ in the CSF spaces:
$D|_{\Omega_{\rm CSF}} = ( 1 + R) D^{\rm Gad}$; and modulated by the
porosity and tortuousity ($\lambda = 1.78$) in the parenchyma:
$D|_{\Omega_{\rm PAR}} = D^{\rm Gad}_{\rm PAR}$. We set $\xi$
depending on whether the PVS segment is fully embedded within the CSF
spaces ($\xi = \xi_{\rm CSF}$) or parenchyma ($\xi = \xi_{\rm EF}$),
or neither (\Cref{sec:more_maths}). Additionally, we increase the
permeability $\xi$ ($100\times$) near the leaf nodes of $\Lambda_a$ to
account for the transition from explicitly resolved PVSs to their
unresolved continuation in the CSF spaces and parenchyma.

\subsection*{Initial conditions}

We set the initial concentrations $c_0, \hat{c}_0$ in the
three-dimensional domain $\Omega$ and networks $\Lambda_a, \Lambda_v$
to be zero for all influx scenarios. For parenchymal
clearance scenarios, we set $c_0 = 1, \hat{c}_0 = 0$.

\subsection*{Numerical approximation of multi-dimensional transport and CSF flow}

\mer{@Rami: Could you draft one paragraph here describing the essential bits of the numerical scheme? I recommend ``describing with words'' to reach relevant audiences. Refer to the Supplementary Methods for details. Mention theoretical expected convergence order.} 

In this section, we provide a brief overview on the employed numerical discretization.  
We refer to \Cref{sec:details_numerical_method} for details. 
Our implementation relies on the FEniCS finite element framework \cite{logg2012automated}; the 3D-1D coupling is handled by its extension FEniCS\textsubscript{ii} \cite{kuchta2020assembly}.
The numerical scheme for the CSF flow equations utilizes polynomial spaces that preserve the divergence free condition \eqref{eq:divergence_equation} on the discrete level \cite{hong2016robust}. This requirement is important for stability in the transport equation, see for example \cite{cesmelioglu2022compatible}. The spaces we used for the velocity are continuous along the normal direction; continuity of the tangential component is enforced via interior penalty approaches \cite{hong2016robust}.  If the exact solution of \eqref{eq:momnetum_equation}--\eqref{eq:divergence_equation} is smooth, then one expects optimal error convergence rates for this approximation. 

For the 3D transport problem, we use the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with weighted averages and upwinding for the convection term \cite{ern2009discontinuous}.  We remark that the choice of DG in the 3D domain is necessary here since  continuous Galerkin methods even when supplemented with artificial diffusion stabilization terms were unstable in our experiments. For the 1D transport problem, we use continuous Galerkin spaces defined over the entire network with additional artificial diffusion silization when the 1D velocity is non--zero.  DG methods for the coupled 3D--1D problem have been recently analyzed  where convergence of the method for the elliptic case is established \cite{masri2024discontinuous}. While the analysis is for DG methods for both the 3D and the 1D problem, we expect similar arguments to hold here. However, note that the 3D--1D coupling induces a singularity in the 3D solution and one can only expect suboptimal error rates near the 1D network. In subdomains excluding the 1D lines, almost optimal rates can be expected for both DG methods \cite{masri2023discontinuous} and CG methods \cite{koppl2016local}.  Extension of the convergence analysis to convection--diffusion problems is an interesting future research direction.

  \caption{Overview of models (-- denotes as immediately above). Each
    PVS cross-section is modelled as a concentric annulus with inner
    radius $R_1$ and outer radius $R_2$ and such that $R_2 = \beta
    R_1$ with $\beta = 2.0$ based on~\cite{eide2024functional}. Let
    $\xi = \dots$ denote the permeability estimated by Koch et
    al.~\cite{koch2023estimates}. Model A and its variations aims to
    quantify the effect of PVS sheaths by varying the permeability
    $\xi$ between the PVS and its surroundings. We consider a fixed
    permeability $\xi_{\rm PVS-PAR}$ based
    on~\cite{koch2023estimates}. \mer{The permeability between the PVS
      and the SAS $\xi_{\rm PVS-SAS}$ must likely be estimated by a
      bit of trial-error from the observations of timings of PVS-SAS
      and SAS from~\cite{eide2024functional}.} \discuss{The
      extracranial solute efflux permeability $\beta_{\rm efflux}$ is
      uniformly distributed over the outer SAS boundary with a
      reasonable rate as baseline\cite{hornkjol2022csf,
        eide2021clinical, ringstad2024glymphatic}.} At baseline, the
    effective diffusion coefficients $D^{\rm x}_{\rm SAS} = D^{\rm
      x}_{\rm PVS}$ of the SAS and PVS represent the free diffusion
    coefficient of Gadubutrol (${\rm x} = {\rm gad}$) in CSF (water),
    and $D^{\rm x}_{\rm PAR}$ the effective diffusion coefficient of
    human cortical tissue, all at body temperature; weighted by a
    dispersion factor $\alpha$ (see Methods). At baseline, we consider
    net flow due to CSF-production in the SAS and PVS:
    $\mathbf{u}_{\rm SAS} > 0$ and $\hat{u} > 0$ (see Methods) but no
    bulk flow in the parenchyma $\mathbf{u}_{\rm PAR} = 0$. Due to the
    timescale for human intracranial tracer transport (minutes to
    hours) compared to typical (cardiac, respiratory, slow vasomotion)
    human intracranial pulsatility (0.1 -- 1 Hz), we consider net
    (constant-in-time) flow fields only in subsequent model variations
    (but see dispersion factor above).  Model B represents
    perivascular pathway scenarios with more rapid flow in the PVS
    induced by vasomotion (PVS I)~\cite{gjerde2023directional}.
    Models C represents a version of the aforementioned scenarios but
    for studying metabolite clearance (instead of solute influx).}
