We consider this manuscript to be appropriate for Nature Communications because it represents a multidisciplinary breakthrough – a decisive advance both within computational mathematics and the neurosciences – that defines a new technological route towards predicting molecular enrichment and clearance of the human brain. These processes are fundamental to brain health and function and stand as a significant area of current research. In spite of their importance, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and their interplay is incomplete. Notably, the field is marked by significant debate, urgently due to challenges associated with the translation and integration of research between scales and species, as well as between theoretical, experimental, and clinical approaches. 

Our study addresses this barrier-to-progress by introducing a high-fidelity in-silico model of intracranial molecular enrichment and clearance, allowing for detailed predictions of the interplay between perivascular pathways, intracranial pulsatility, compartmentalization and morphology. Our approach is built on a rigorous mathematical foundation, represents a major step forward both in terms of capabilities and fidelity, and is accompanied by an openly available software platform. Our findings reconcile, integrate, and extend insights from clinical, experimental, and theoretical studies, and lay a new foundation for in-silico predictions of tailored drug delivery to the brain and for early diagnostics of impaired brain clearance.
