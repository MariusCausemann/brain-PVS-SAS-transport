               awake head-fixed mice to assess the role of spontaneous
               vasomotion in paravascular clearance. Vasomotion correlated with
               paravascular clearance of fluorescent dextran from the
               interstitial fluid. Increasing the amplitude of vasomotion by
               means of visually evoked vascular responses resulted in increased
               clearance rates in the visual cortex of awake mice. Evoked
               vascular reactivity was impaired in mice with CAA, which
               corresponded to slower clearance rates. Our findings suggest that
               low-frequency arteriolar oscillations drive drainage of solutes.
               Targeting naturally occurring vasomotion in patients with CAA or

               the PVS and the subarachnoid space (SAS). In simulations with

               appreciable fluid exchange between the PVS and the SAS. However,
               when the arteriole dilated, as seen during functional hyperemia,

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Today's availability of medical imaging and
               computational resources set the scene for high-fidelity
               computational modelling of brain biomechanics. The brain and its
               environment feature a dynamic and complex interplay between the
               tissue, blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid
               (ISF). Here, we design a computational platform for modelling and
               simulation of intracranial dynamics, and assess the models'
               validity in terms of clinically relevant indicators of brain
               pulsatility. Focusing on the dynamic interaction between tissue
               motion and ISF/CSF flow, we treat the pulsatile cerebral blood
               flow as a prescribed input of the model. METHODS: We develop
               finite element models of cardiac-induced fully coupled pulsatile
               CSF flow and tissue motion in the human brain environment. The
               three-dimensional model geometry is derived from magnetic
               resonance images (MRI) and features a high level of detail
               including the brain tissue, the ventricular system, and the
               cranial subarachnoid space (SAS). We model the brain parenchyma
               at the organ-scale as an elastic medium permeated by an
               extracellular fluid network and describe flow of CSF in the SAS
               and ventricles as viscous fluid movement. Representing vascular
               expansion during the cardiac cycle, a prescribed pulsatile net
               blood flow distributed over the brain parenchyma acts as the
               driver of motion. Additionally, we investigate the effect of
               model variations on a set of clinically relevant quantities of
               interest. RESULTS: Our model predicts a complex interplay between
               the CSF-filled spaces and poroelastic parenchyma in terms of ICP,
               CSF flow, and parenchymal displacements. Variations in the ICP
               are dominated by their temporal amplitude, but with small spatial
               variations in both the CSF-filled spaces and the parenchyma.
               Induced by ICP differences, we find substantial ventricular and
               cranial-spinal CSF flow, some flow in the cranial SAS, and small
               pulsatile ISF velocities in the brain parenchyma. Moreover, the
               model predicts a funnel-shaped deformation of parenchymal tissue
               in dorsal direction at the beginning of the cardiac cycle.
               CONCLUSIONS: Our model accurately depicts the complex interplay
               of ICP, CSF flow and brain tissue movement and is well-aligned
               with clinical observations. It offers a qualitative and
               quantitative platform for detailed investigation of coupled
               intracranial dynamics and interplay, both under physiological and

               generation tools were then used to develop a three-dimensional
               fluid-structure interaction model of the CSF flow inside the CNS.
               The CSF spaces were discretized using the finite-element method
               and the constitutive equations for fluid and solid motion solved
               in ADINA-FSI 8.6. Model predictions of CSF velocity magnitude and
               stroke volume were found to be in excellent agreement with the
               experimental data. CSF pressure gradients and amplitudes were
               computed in all regions of the CNS. The computed pressure
               gradients and amplitudes closely match values obtained
               clinically. The highest pressure amplitude of 77 Pa was predicted
               to occur in the lateral ventricles. The pressure gradient between
               the lateral ventricles and the lumbar region of the spinal canal
               did not exceed 132 Pa (~1 mmHg) at any time during the cardiac

               in the ventricles was visualized, revealing the complex mixing

               this article is a prerequisite for developing a mechanistic

               critical to care and prevention of neurological disease and
               injury. A key question is whether transport occurs primarily by
               diffusion, or also by convection or dispersion. Dynamic
               contrast-enhanced (DCE-MRI) experiments have long reported solute
               transport in the brain that appears to be faster than diffusion
               alone, but this transport rate has not been quantified to a
               physically relevant value that can be compared to known diffusive
               rates of tracers. METHODS: In this work, DCE-MRI experimental
               data is analyzed using subject-specific finite-element models to
               quantify transport in different anatomical regions across the
               whole mouse brain. The set of regional effective diffusivities
               ([Formula: see text]), a transport parameter combining all
               mechanisms of transport, that best represent the experimental
               data are determined and compared to apparent diffusivity
               ([Formula: see text]), the known rate of diffusion through brain
               tissue, to draw conclusions about dominant transport mechanisms
               in each region. RESULTS: In the perivascular regions of major
               arteries, [Formula: see text] for gadoteridol (550 Da) was over
               10,000 times greater than [Formula: see text]. In the brain

               space of smaller blood vessels, [Formula: see text] was 10-25
               times greater than [Formula: see text]. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis
               concludes that convection is present throughout the brain.
               Convection is dominant in the perivascular space of major surface
               and branching arteries (Pe > 1000) and significant to large

              metabolic waste from the brain, a process whose dysregulation is
              linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. Traditional
              approaches like particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) are limited by
              their reliance on single-plane two-dimensional measurements, which
              fail to capture the complex dynamics of CSF flow fully. To
              overcome these limitations, we employ Artificial Intelligence
              Velocimetry (AIV) to reconstruct three-dimensional velocities,
              infer pressure and wall shear stress, and quantify flow rates.
              Given the experimental nature of the data and inherent variability
              in biological systems, robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) is
              essential. Towards this end, we have modified the baseline AIV
              architecture to address aleatoric uncertainty caused by noisy
              experimental data, enhancing our measurement refinement
              capabilities. We also implement UQ for the model and epistemic
              uncertainties arising from the governing equations and network
              representation. Toward this end, we test multiple governing laws,
              representation models, and initializations. Our approach not only
              advances the accuracy of CSF flow quantification but also can be

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Cardiac pulsation propels blood through the
               cerebrovascular network to maintain cerebral homeostasis. The
               cerebrovascular network is uniquely surrounded by paravascular
               cerebrospinal fluid (pCSF), which plays a crucial role in waste
               removal, and its flow is suspected to be driven by arterial
               pulsations. Despite its importance, the relationship between
               vascular and paravascular fluid dynamics throughout the cardiac
               cycle remains poorly understood in humans. METHODS: In this
               study, we developed a non-invasive neuroimaging approach to
               investigate the coupling between pulsatile vascular and pCSF
               dynamics within the subarachnoid space of the human brain.
               Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) and dynamic
               diffusion-weighted imaging (dynDWI) were retrospectively
               cardiac-aligned to represent cerebral hemodynamics and pCSF
               motion, respectively. We measured the time between peaks (∆TTP)
               in d d ϕ f M R I and dynDWI waveforms and measured their coupling
               by calculating the waveforms correlation after peak alignment
               (correlation at aligned peaks). We compared the ∆TTP and
               correlation at aligned peaks between younger [mean age: 27.9
               (3.3) years, n = 9] and older adults [mean age: 70.5 (6.6) years,
               n = 20], and assessed their reproducibility within subjects and
               across different imaging protocols. RESULTS: Hemodynamic changes
               consistently precede pCSF motion. ∆TTP was significantly shorter
               in younger adults compared to older adults (-0.015 vs. -0.069, p
               < 0.05). The correlation at aligned peaks were high and did not
               differ between younger and older adults (0.833 vs. 0.776, p =
               0.153). The ∆TTP and correlation at aligned peaks were robust
               across fMRI protocols (∆TTP: -0.15 vs. -0.053, p = 0.239;
               correlation at aligned peaks: 0.813 vs. 0.812, p = 0.985) and
               demonstrated good to excellent within-subject reproducibility
               (∆TTP: intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.36; correlation at
               aligned peaks: intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.89).
               CONCLUSION: This study proposes a non-invasive technique to
               evaluate vascular and paravascular fluid dynamics. Our findings
               reveal a consistent and robust cardiac pulsation-driven coupling
               between cerebral hemodynamics and pCSF dynamics in both younger
               and older adults.",

               subarachnoid space and parenchyma have been found to
               preferentially transport through the cortex perivascular spaces
               (PVS) but the transport phenomena involved are unclear. METHODS:
               In this study two hydraulic network models were used to predict
               fluid motion produced by blood vessel pulsations and estimate the
               contribution made to solute transport in PVS and parenchyma. The
               effect of varying pulse amplitude and timing, PVS dimensions, and
               tissue hydraulic conductivity on fluid motion was investigated.
               RESULTS: Periodic vessel pulses resulted in oscillatory fluid
               motion in PVS and parenchyma but no net flow over time. For
               baseline parameters, PVS and parenchyma peak fluid velocity was
               on the order of 10 μm/s and 1 nm/s, with corresponding Peclet
               numbers below 103 and 10-1 respectively. Peak fluid velocity in
               the PVS and parenchyma tended to increase with increasing pulse
               amplitude and vessel size, and exhibited asymptotic relationships
               with hydraulic conductivity. CONCLUSIONS: Solute transport in
               parenchyma was predicted to be diffusion dominated, with a
               negligible contribution from convection. In the PVS, dispersion
               due to oscillating flow likely plays a significant role in PVS
               rapid transport observed in previous in vivo experiments. This
               dispersive effect could be more significant than convective
               solute transport from net flow that may exist in PVS and should
               be studied further.",

               cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) functions as a sink for brain
               extracellular solutes, but it is not clear how solutes from the
               brain interstitium move from the parenchyma to the CSF. We
               demonstrate that a substantial portion of subarachnoid CSF cycles
               through the brain interstitial space. On the basis of in vivo
               two-photon imaging of small fluorescent tracers, we showed that
               CSF enters the parenchyma along paravascular spaces that surround
               penetrating arteries and that brain interstitial fluid is cleared
               along paravenous drainage pathways. Animals lacking the water
               channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in astrocytes exhibit slowed CSF
               influx through this system and a ~70\% reduction in interstitial

               transported along this route, and deletion of the Aqp4 gene
               suppressed the clearance of soluble amyloid-beta, suggesting that
               this pathway may remove amyloid-beta from the central nervous
               system. Clearance through paravenous flow may also regulate
               extracellular levels of proteins involved with neurodegenerative
               conditions, its impairment perhaps contributing to the

               Previous work suggests that interstitial fluid drains along the
               walls of arteries. AIMS: to define the pathways within the walls
               of capillaries and arteries for drainage of fluid and solutes out
               of the brain. METHODS: Fluorescent soluble tracers, dextran (3
               kDa) and ovalbumin (40 kDa), and particulate fluospheres (0.02
               microm and 1.0 microm in diameter) were injected into the corpus
               striatum of mice. Brains were examined from 5 min to 7 days by
               immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: soluble
               tracers initially spread diffusely through brain parenchyma and
               then drain out of the brain along basement membranes of
               capillaries and arteries. Some tracer is takenf up by vascular
               smooth muscle cells and by perivascular macrophages. No
               perivascular drainage was observed when dextran was injected into
               mouse brains following cardiac arrest. Fluospheres expand
               perivascular spaces between vessel walls and surrounding brain,
               are ingested by perivascular macrophages but do not appear to
               leave the brain even following an inflammatory challenge with
               lipopolysaccharide or kainate. CONCLUSIONS: capillary and artery
               basement membranes act as 'lymphatics of the brain' for drainage
               of fluid and solutes; such drainage appears to require continued
               cardiac output as it ceases following cardiac arrest. This
               drainage pathway does not permit migration of cells from brain
               parenchyma to the periphery. Amyloid-beta is deposited in
               basement membrane drainage pathways in cerebral amyloid
               angiopathy, and may impede elimination of amyloid-beta and
               interstitial fluid from the brain in Alzheimer's disease. Soluble
               antigens, but not cells, drain from the brain by perivascular
               pathways. This atypical pattern of drainage may contribute to
               partial immune privilege of the brain and play a role in
               neuroimmunological diseases such as multiple sclerosis.",

               so that drugs are concentrated in the targeted tissue, with
               minimal leakage outside the targeted zone. Experiments have shown
               that liposomes, viral vectors, high molecular weight tracers, and

               tunnels through which cortical interstitial solutes are cleared
               from the brain, has recently been linked to sleep and traumatic
               brain injury, both of which can affect the progression of
               migraine. This led us to investigate the connection between
               migraine and the glymphatic system. Taking advantage of a novel
               in vivo method we developed using two-photon microscopy to
               visualize the paravascular space (PVS) in naive uninjected mice,
               we show that a single wave of cortical spreading depression
               (CSD), an animal model of migraine aura, induces a rapid and
               nearly complete closure of the PVS around surface as well as
               penetrating cortical arteries and veins lasting several minutes,
               and gradually recovering over 30 min. A temporal mismatch between
               the constriction or dilation of the blood vessel lumen and the
               closure of the PVS suggests that this closure is not likely to
               result from changes in vessel diameter. We also show that CSD
               impairs glymphatic flow, as indicated by the reduced rate at
               which intraparenchymally injected dye was cleared from the cortex
               to the PVS. This is the first observation of a PVS closure in
               connection with an abnormal cortical event that underlies a
               neurological disorder. More specifically, the findings
               demonstrate a link between the glymphatic system and migraine,
               and suggest a novel mechanism for regulation of glymphatic
               flow.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Impairment of brain solute clearance
               through the recently described glymphatic system has been linked
               with traumatic brain injury, prolonged wakefulness, and aging.
               This paper shows that cortical spreading depression, the neural
               correlate of migraine aura, closes the paravascular space and
               impairs glymphatic flow. This closure holds the potential to
               define a novel mechanism for regulation of glymphatic flow. It
               also implicates the glymphatic system in the altered cortical and
               endothelial functioning of the migraine brain.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through brain
               perivascular spaces (PVSs) is essential for the clearance of
               interstitial metabolic waste products whose accumulation and
               aggregation is a key mechanism of pathogenesis in many diseases.
               The PVS geometry has important implications for CSF flow as it
               affects CSF and solute transport rates. Thus, the size and shape
               of the perivascular spaces are essential parameters for models of
               CSF transport in the brain and require accurate quantification.
               METHODS: We segmented two-photon images of pial (surface) PVSs
               and the adjacent arteries and characterized their sizes and
               shapes of cross sections from 14 PVS segments in 9 mice. Based on
               the analysis, we propose an idealized model that approximates the
               cross-sectional size and shape of pial PVSs, closely matching
               their area ratios and hydraulic resistances. RESULTS: The ratio
               of PVS-to-vessel area varies widely across the cross sections
               analyzed. The hydraulic resistance per unit length of the PVS
               scales with the PVS cross-sectional area, and we found a
               power-law fit that predicts resistance as a function of the area.
               Three idealized geometric models were compared to PVSs imaged in
               vivo, and their accuracy in reproducing hydraulic resistances and
               PVS-to-vessel area ratios were evaluated. The area ratio was
               obtained across different cross sections, and we found that the
               distribution peaks for the original PVS and its closest idealized
               fit (polynomial fit) were 1.12 and 1.21, respectively. The peak
               of the hydraulic resistance distribution is [Formula: see text]
               Pa s/m[Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] Pa s/m[Formula:
               see text] for the segmentation and its closest idealized fit,
               respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PVS hydraulic resistance can be
               reasonably predicted as a function of the PVS area. The proposed
               polynomial-based fit most closely captures the shape of the PVS
               with respect to area ratio and hydraulic resistance. Idealized
               PVS shapes are convenient for modeling, which can be used to
               better understand how anatomical variations affect clearance and
               drug transport.",

               brain. Their anatomy and function have been described for
               arteries, but PVS around veins remain poorly characterized. Using
               in vivo 2-photon imaging in mice, we determined the size of the
               PVS around arteries and veins, and their connection with the
               subarachnoid space. After infusion of 70 kD FITC-dextran into the
               cerebrospinal fluid via the cisterna magna, labeled PVS were
               evident around arteries, but veins showed less frequent labeling
               of the PVS. The size of the PVS correlated with blood vessel size
               for both pial arteries and veins, but not for penetrating
               vessels. The PVS around pial arteries and veins was separated
               from the subarachnoid space by a thin meningeal layer, which did
               not form a barrier for the tracer. In vivo, FITC-dextran signal
               was observed adjacent to the vessel wall, but minimally within
               the wall itself. Post-mortem, there was a significant shift in
               the tracer's location within the arterial wall, extending into
               the smooth muscle layer. Taken together, these findings suggest
               that the PVS around veins has a limited role in the exchange of
               solutes between CSF and brain parenchyma.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Periarterial spaces (PASs) are annular channels that
               surround arteries in the brain and contain cerebrospinal fluid
               (CSF): a flow of CSF in these channels is thought to be an
               important part of the brain's system for clearing metabolic
               wastes. In vivo observations reveal that they are not concentric,
               circular annuli, however: the outer boundaries are often oblate,
               and the arteries that form the inner boundaries are often offset
               from the central axis. METHODS: We model PAS cross-sections as
               circles surrounded by ellipses and vary the radii of the circles,
               major and minor axes of the ellipses, and two-dimensional
               eccentricities of the circles with respect to the ellipses. For
               each shape, we solve the governing Navier-Stokes equation to
               determine the velocity profile for steady laminar flow and then
               compute the corresponding hydraulic resistance. RESULTS: We find
               that the observed shapes of PASs have lower hydraulic resistance
               than concentric, circular annuli of the same size, and therefore
               allow faster, more efficient flow of cerebrospinal fluid. We find
               that the minimum hydraulic resistance (and therefore maximum flow
               rate) for a given PAS cross-sectional area occurs when the
               ellipse is elongated and intersects the circle, dividing the PAS
               into two lobes, as is common around pial arteries. We also find
               that if both the inner and outer boundaries are nearly circular,
               the minimum hydraulic resistance occurs when the eccentricity is
               large, as is common around penetrating arteries. CONCLUSIONS: The
               concentric circular annulus assumed in recent studies is not a
               good model of the shape of actual PASs observed in vivo, and it
               greatly overestimates the hydraulic resistance of the PAS. Our
               parameterization can be used to incorporate more realistic
               resistances into hydraulic network models of flow of
               cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Our results demonstrate that
               actual shapes observed in vivo are nearly optimal, in the sense
               of offering the least hydraulic resistance. This optimization may
               well represent an evolutionary adaptation that maximizes
               clearance of metabolic waste from the brain.",
