               cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) functions as a sink for brain
               extracellular solutes, but it is not clear how solutes from the
               brain interstitium move from the parenchyma to the CSF. We
               demonstrate that a substantial portion of subarachnoid CSF cycles
               through the brain interstitial space. On the basis of in vivo
               two-photon imaging of small fluorescent tracers, we showed that
               CSF enters the parenchyma along paravascular spaces that surround
               penetrating arteries and that brain interstitial fluid is cleared
               along paravenous drainage pathways. Animals lacking the water
               channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in astrocytes exhibit slowed CSF
               influx through this system and a ~70\% reduction in interstitial
               solute clearance, suggesting that the bulk fluid flow between
               these anatomical influx and efflux routes is supported by
               astrocytic water transport. Fluorescent-tagged amyloid-beta, a
               peptide thought to be pathogenic in Alzheimer's disease, was
               transported along this route, and deletion of the Aqp4 gene
               suppressed the clearance of soluble amyloid-beta, suggesting that
               this pathway may remove amyloid-beta from the central nervous
               system. Clearance through paravenous flow may also regulate
               extracellular levels of proteins involved with neurodegenerative
               conditions, its impairment perhaps contributing to the
               mis-accumulation of soluble proteins.",

               role in homeostasis in the brain, but the pathways are unclear.
               Previous work suggests that interstitial fluid drains along the
               walls of arteries. AIMS: to define the pathways within the walls
               of capillaries and arteries for drainage of fluid and solutes out
               of the brain. METHODS: Fluorescent soluble tracers, dextran (3
               kDa) and ovalbumin (40 kDa), and particulate fluospheres (0.02
               microm and 1.0 microm in diameter) were injected into the corpus
               striatum of mice. Brains were examined from 5 min to 7 days by
               immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: soluble
               tracers initially spread diffusely through brain parenchyma and
               then drain out of the brain along basement membranes of
               capillaries and arteries. Some tracer is takenf up by vascular
               smooth muscle cells and by perivascular macrophages. No
               perivascular drainage was observed when dextran was injected into
               mouse brains following cardiac arrest. Fluospheres expand
               perivascular spaces between vessel walls and surrounding brain,
               are ingested by perivascular macrophages but do not appear to
               leave the brain even following an inflammatory challenge with
               lipopolysaccharide or kainate. CONCLUSIONS: capillary and artery
               basement membranes act as 'lymphatics of the brain' for drainage
               of fluid and solutes; such drainage appears to require continued
               cardiac output as it ceases following cardiac arrest. This
               drainage pathway does not permit migration of cells from brain
               parenchyma to the periphery. Amyloid-beta is deposited in
               basement membrane drainage pathways in cerebral amyloid
               angiopathy, and may impede elimination of amyloid-beta and
               interstitial fluid from the brain in Alzheimer's disease. Soluble
               antigens, but not cells, drain from the brain by perivascular
               pathways. This atypical pattern of drainage may contribute to
               partial immune privilege of the brain and play a role in
               neuroimmunological diseases such as multiple sclerosis.",

               to understand how large drug constructs move through neural

               so that drugs are concentrated in the targeted tissue, with
               minimal leakage outside the targeted zone. Experiments have shown
               that liposomes, viral vectors, high molecular weight tracers, and

               perivascular spaces of blood vessels within the brain parenchyma.
               In this work, we used two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy

               tunnels through which cortical interstitial solutes are cleared
               from the brain, has recently been linked to sleep and traumatic
               brain injury, both of which can affect the progression of
               migraine. This led us to investigate the connection between
               migraine and the glymphatic system. Taking advantage of a novel
               in vivo method we developed using two-photon microscopy to
               visualize the paravascular space (PVS) in naive uninjected mice,
               we show that a single wave of cortical spreading depression
               (CSD), an animal model of migraine aura, induces a rapid and
               nearly complete closure of the PVS around surface as well as
               penetrating cortical arteries and veins lasting several minutes,
               and gradually recovering over 30 min. A temporal mismatch between
               the constriction or dilation of the blood vessel lumen and the
               closure of the PVS suggests that this closure is not likely to
               result from changes in vessel diameter. We also show that CSD
               impairs glymphatic flow, as indicated by the reduced rate at
               which intraparenchymally injected dye was cleared from the cortex
               to the PVS. This is the first observation of a PVS closure in
               connection with an abnormal cortical event that underlies a
               neurological disorder. More specifically, the findings
               demonstrate a link between the glymphatic system and migraine,

               flow.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Impairment of brain solute clearance
               through the recently described glymphatic system has been linked
               with traumatic brain injury, prolonged wakefulness, and aging.
               This paper shows that cortical spreading depression, the neural
               correlate of migraine aura, closes the paravascular space and
               impairs glymphatic flow. This closure holds the potential to
               define a novel mechanism for regulation of glymphatic flow. It
               also implicates the glymphatic system in the altered cortical and
               endothelial functioning of the migraine brain.",

               perivascular spaces (PVSs) is essential for the clearance of
               interstitial metabolic waste products whose accumulation and
               aggregation is a key mechanism of pathogenesis in many diseases.
               The PVS geometry has important implications for CSF flow as it
               affects CSF and solute transport rates. Thus, the size and shape
               of the perivascular spaces are essential parameters for models of
               CSF transport in the brain and require accurate quantification.
               METHODS: We segmented two-photon images of pial (surface) PVSs
               and the adjacent arteries and characterized their sizes and
               shapes of cross sections from 14 PVS segments in 9 mice. Based on
               the analysis, we propose an idealized model that approximates the
               cross-sectional size and shape of pial PVSs, closely matching
               their area ratios and hydraulic resistances. RESULTS: The ratio
               of PVS-to-vessel area varies widely across the cross sections
               analyzed. The hydraulic resistance per unit length of the PVS
               scales with the PVS cross-sectional area, and we found a
               power-law fit that predicts resistance as a function of the area.
               Three idealized geometric models were compared to PVSs imaged in
               vivo, and their accuracy in reproducing hydraulic resistances and
               PVS-to-vessel area ratios were evaluated. The area ratio was
               obtained across different cross sections, and we found that the
               distribution peaks for the original PVS and its closest idealized
               fit (polynomial fit) were 1.12 and 1.21, respectively. The peak
               of the hydraulic resistance distribution is [Formula: see text]
               Pa s/m[Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] Pa s/m[Formula:
               see text] for the segmentation and its closest idealized fit,
               respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PVS hydraulic resistance can be
               reasonably predicted as a function of the PVS area. The proposed
               polynomial-based fit most closely captures the shape of the PVS
               with respect to area ratio and hydraulic resistance. Idealized
               PVS shapes are convenient for modeling, which can be used to
               better understand how anatomical variations affect clearance and
               drug transport.",

               PVS around arteries and veins, and their connection with the
               subarachnoid space. After infusion of 70 kD FITC-dextran into the

               evident around arteries, but veins showed less frequent labeling

               for both pial arteries and veins, but not for penetrating
               vessels. The PVS around pial arteries and veins was separated
               from the subarachnoid space by a thin meningeal layer, which did

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Periarterial spaces (PASs) are annular channels that
               surround arteries in the brain and contain cerebrospinal fluid
               (CSF): a flow of CSF in these channels is thought to be an
               important part of the brain's system for clearing metabolic
               wastes. In vivo observations reveal that they are not concentric,
               circular annuli, however: the outer boundaries are often oblate,
               and the arteries that form the inner boundaries are often offset
               from the central axis. METHODS: We model PAS cross-sections as
               circles surrounded by ellipses and vary the radii of the circles,
               major and minor axes of the ellipses, and two-dimensional
               eccentricities of the circles with respect to the ellipses. For
               each shape, we solve the governing Navier-Stokes equation to
               determine the velocity profile for steady laminar flow and then
               compute the corresponding hydraulic resistance. RESULTS: We find
               that the observed shapes of PASs have lower hydraulic resistance
               than concentric, circular annuli of the same size, and therefore
               allow faster, more efficient flow of cerebrospinal fluid. We find
               that the minimum hydraulic resistance (and therefore maximum flow
               rate) for a given PAS cross-sectional area occurs when the
               ellipse is elongated and intersects the circle, dividing the PAS
               into two lobes, as is common around pial arteries. We also find
               that if both the inner and outer boundaries are nearly circular,
               the minimum hydraulic resistance occurs when the eccentricity is
               large, as is common around penetrating arteries. CONCLUSIONS: The
               concentric circular annulus assumed in recent studies is not a
               good model of the shape of actual PASs observed in vivo, and it
               greatly overestimates the hydraulic resistance of the PAS. Our
               parameterization can be used to incorporate more realistic
               resistances into hydraulic network models of flow of
               cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Our results demonstrate that
               actual shapes observed in vivo are nearly optimal, in the sense
               of offering the least hydraulic resistance. This optimization may
               well represent an evolutionary adaptation that maximizes
               clearance of metabolic waste from the brain.",
