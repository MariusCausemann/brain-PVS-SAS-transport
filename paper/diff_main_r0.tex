\section*{Introduction}

% What is the big picture problem and why is it important? 
The mechanisms underlying molecular transport within the intracranial
space are fundamental to human brain health and
function. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
and Huntington's disease are all associated with abnormal accumulation
of protein aggregates together with alterations in transport and
clearance characteristics~\cite{rasmussen2018glymphatic,
  harrison2020impaired, eide2023plasma, liu2024glymphatic}. Moreover,
sleep and conversely sleep-deprivation play a definite yet enigmatic
role in modulating molecular \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{enrichment }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{transport }\DIFaddend and
clearance~\cite{xie2013sleep, eide2021sleep, eide2022altered,
  miao2024brain, hauglund2025norepinephrine}. In the last decade,
established theories have been challenged by new findings \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{revealing a
greater degree of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on }\DIFaddend molecular
movement and exchange~\cite{iliff2012paravascular,
  ringstad2017glymphatic, louveau2017understanding,
  proulx2021cerebrospinal, bohr2022glymphatic}, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as well as substantial
variability in
enrichment and clearance }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{including substantial
variability }\DIFaddend between individuals and between patient
cohorts~\cite{ringstad2018brain, eide2021direction, eide2021impaired,
  eide2022altered}. These observations provide distinct opportunities
(and challenges) for personalized medicine e.g.~for tailored
intrathecal delivery of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{chemotherapy~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{lohela2022glymphatic} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD

such
as methodextrate in acute lymphoblastic leukemia
patients\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{kadan2009comparison}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, }\DIFaddend and for early diagnostics of
impaired brain clearance\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{~}\DIFdelend \cite{eide2021clinical, van2024human}. In
spite of their importance, our understanding of these mechanisms is
incomplete with open challenges and significant debate -- in part
relating to the translation of knowledge between scales, species,
experimental protocols, clinical cohorts, and individuals.

Perivascular pathways along the brain surface and within the brain
parenchyma have long been hypothesized to serve a designated role in
this context~\cite{rennels1985evidence, zhang1990interrelationships,
  ichimura1991distribution, carare2008solutes, iliff2012paravascular,
  foley2012realtime, hannocks2018molecular, van2024caa}. Recently, Eide and
Ringstad~\cite{eide2024functional} and Yamamoto et
al~\cite{yamamoto2024perivascular} demonstrated that perivascular
spaces (PVSs) define preferential pathways for molecular transport in
humans, with delayed periarterial enrichment in dementia
subtypes~\cite{eide2024functional}. Perivascular flow of cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) clearly contributes to this transport, and is inherently
associated with vascular pulsations~\cite{hadaczek2006perivascular,
  iliff2013cerebral, bedussi2018paravascular, mestre2018flow,
  boster2023artificial, hirschler2024region}. Fluid mechanics
considerations point at intracranial pressure differences and shorter
wavelength vascular wall pulsations as drivers of directional net flow
and convection in the PVS~\cite{bilston2003arterial, rey2018pulsatile,
  daversin2020mechanisms, kedarasetti2020functional,
  gjerde2023directional, nozaleda2024arterial}, while longer waves
such as the pulse wave primarily contribute to oscillatory flow and
dispersion~\cite{asgari2016glymphatic, sharp2019dispersion, thomas2019fluid,
  kedarasetti2020arterial, troyetsky2021dispersion, 
  martinac2021phase}. In the bigger picture, CSF is produced by the
choroid plexus~\cite{damkier2013cerebrospinal,
  steffensen2018cotransporter, liu2020direct}, pulsates through the
ventricular system, cisterns, and subarachnoid space (SAS) in
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{synchrony }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{association }\DIFaddend with cardiac, respiratory, and neural
waves~\cite{greitz1993pulsatile, wagshul2011pulsating,
  sweetman2011cerebrospinal, fultz2019coupled, vinje2019respiratory,
  eide2021direction, causemann2022human, williams2023neural,
  zimmermann2023total}, and drains via the dural sinuses, meningeal
lymphatics, cranial nerves, or other efflux
pathways~\cite{proulx2021cerebrospinal}. However, how these
physiological factors and physical mechanisms integrate to enhance or
impair human intracranial molecular transport over larger spatial
scales and longer time scales remain unknown. A related key question
is to what extent surface PVSs are separated from the SAS by
structural barriers~\cite{zhang1990interrelationships,
  weller2005microscopic, bedussi2017paravascular,
  pizzo2018intrathecal, mestre2022periarteriolar,
  mollgard2023mesothelium, smets2024perivascular, eide2024functional},
and in turn to what extent such structural compartmentalization is a
prerequisite for effective perivascular transport.

% What are our research questions and how do we answer them
In this study, by leveraging geometric model reduction and
mixed-dimensional modelling~\cite{masri2024modelling}, structural
magnetic resonance (MR) images~\cite{hodneland2019new}, and high
performance computing, we introduce an integrated computational model
of intracranial molecular \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{enrichment and clearance}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{transport}\DIFaddend . Focusing on the interplay between
perivascular pathways, pulsatility and CSF flow dynamics, the model
predicts the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of a solute
concentration within a detailed geometric representation of the human
SAS and ventricular system, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in }\DIFaddend networks of surface PVSs \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(i.e.~those
surrounding arteries and veins in the SAS), and in }\DIFaddend the brain
parenchyma. In terms of transport dynamics, we account for
heterogeneous diffusion, dispersive mixing induced by cardiac and
respiratory pulsatility in the CSF spaces and PVSs, convective fluid
flow driven by CSF production and peristaltic pumping, as well as
solute exchange and clearance across semi-permeable
membranes. Comparing with glymphatic MRI
studies~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{ringstad2017glymphatic, ringstad2018brain,
  watts2019measuring}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{ringstad2017glymphatic, ringstad2018brain,
  watts2019measuring, eide2024functional}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , the in-silico predictions
accurately represent \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{molecular }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tracer }\DIFaddend enrichment patterns, timing and
intercompartmental distributions. This open platform~\cite{ZENODO}
thus provides a technological opportunity for qualitatively and
quantitatively exploring key open questions relating to molecular
movement within the human brain environment such as the role of
pulsatility, perivascular pathways, structural compartmentalization,
or morphology.

% Main findings and outlook
By exploring this high-dimensional parameter space, we propose that
the balance between CSF production and intracranial pulsatility is key
to shaping the large-scale features of intracranial enrichment
patterns, with the potential to span a wide range of individual and
cohort variability. Moreover, we predict that CSF production, cardiac-
and respiratory pulsatility is not sufficient to explain early
perivascular enrichment, but that fluid flow induced by low-frequency
vasomotion in surface periarterial spaces (on the order of 10 \textmu
m/s) is sufficient, even in the absence of a structural
compartmentalization of the PVS. Conversely, enlarged PVSs in the SAS
will cause a substantial reduction in cardiac- and vasomotion-driven
flow velocities, strongly delay perivascular transport, and thus
impair intracranial enrichment. These findings transfer, reconcile, 
integrate and extend insights from clinical, experimental, and theoretical 
studies, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{lay a new foundation for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{provide a framework for future }\DIFaddend in-silico studies of personalized
 intrathecal drug delivery and brain clearance.

Using previously published multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) data~\cite{hodneland2019new, deistung2009tof,
  schweser2012quantitative, reichenbach2012future,
  deistung2017overview}, we construct a multiscale computational
representation of the human intracranial compartments consisting of
the CSF spaces and brain parenchyma as three-dimensional (3D) domains
and with the PVSs surrounding major surface arteries and veins as
embedded networks of topologically one-dimensional (1D) curves
(\Cref{fig:results1}A--B). We consider a solute concentration field,
varying in space and time, in the 3D domains and in the PVS networks,
and assume that the solute can cross between these compartments
through semi-permeable membranes. As the drivers and modes of
intracranial transport are under substantial
debate\cite{smith2019going, proulx2021cerebrospinal,
  bohr2022glymphatic, hladky2022glymphatic, betsholtz2024advances},
our first target is to establish a baseline model accounting for a
reasonably conservative set of mechanisms and their integrated effect
over a timescale of several minutes to a few days. To this end, we
assume that the solute will (i) diffuse within all compartments, with
diffusivity depending on the effective properties of the relevant
medium\cite{sykova2008diffusion}; (ii) experience significant
dispersive effects due to the pulsatile flow of CSF induced by the
cardiac and respiratory cycles\cite{vinje2019respiratory,
  sharp2019dispersion, ray2021quantitative, troyetsky2021dispersion};
and (iii) be convected by a (small) net flow of CSF resulting from
production in the choroid plexus with CSF efflux across the upper
convexity\cite{hornkjol2022csf} and from the peristaltic pumping
effect of pulse wave pulsations in surface periarterial
spaces~\cite{mestre2018flow, gjerde2023directional}. Mathematically, this model is represented by a
mixed-dimensional system of coupled time-dependent partial
differential equations\cite{masri2024modelling}, which we solve
numerically with high accuracy using a mass-conserving finite element
scheme and the FEniCS finite element software\cite{alnaes2015fenics,
  kuchta2020assembly} (see Methods). The computational framework and
associated software are all openly available~\cite{ZENODO}.

Simulating a glymphatic MRI protocol~\cite{ringstad2017glymphatic,
ringstad2018brain, eide2024functional}(\Cref{fig:results1}C), we then predict the spreading of $0.5$ mmol intrathecally injected Gadobutrol after its appearance at the craniocervical junction\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, represented by tracer inflow across the spinal SAS boundary over the first two hours }\DIFaddend (\Cref{fig:results1}D--E). 
After one hour, the in-silico
tracer moves upwards in the SAS frontally of the brainstem, and
quickly reaches the supratentorial regions. Here, it spreads both
posterior through the quadrigeminal cistern and the longitudinal
fissure, and anteriorly through the outer SAS, reaching the top of the
cerebral cortex after around 12 hours. After 24 hours, the tracer
covers most of the brain surface (with the exception of some posterior
regions) and has penetrated substantially into the parenchymal
tissue. This pattern is reflected in the mean tracer concentrations in
each compartment, where the CSF space reaches its peak of
$1.4\,$mmol/l after 2 hours, followed by the arterial PVS
concentration peak ($2.9\,$mmol/l after 4 hours)
(\Cref{fig:results1}F). While the mean concentrations in these
compartments drop soon after peaking, the parenchymal tissue
slowly enriches with tracer over the first 24 hours, with a final
value of $0.3$ mmol/l. Overall, about 40\% of the total amount of
tracer remains in the cranium 24 hours post-injection, with the largest
share in the CSF (53\%), followed by the parenchyma (35\%), the
venous PVS (8\%) and the arterial PVS
(5\%) (\Cref{fig:results1}G).

The \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tracer }\DIFaddend enrichment patterns observed clinically after intrathecal
injection of contrast differ substantially between subjects and
between pathological conditions~\cite{ringstad2018brain,
  eide2021direction, eide2021impaired, eide2022altered}. These
neurological conditions are also associated with alterations in the
pulsatile flow of CSF in the ventricular system and
SAS~\cite{eide2021direction}. Clearly, key physiological factors such
as cardiac pulsatility and respiration easily differ between
individuals and between both pathological and physiological states. We
therefore next asked to what extent -- and how -- variations in CSF
pulsatility would affect the intracranial enrichment characteristics.

For the CSF dynamics in our baseline model, we combine the net
contribution to CSF flow induced by CSF production with the integrated
dispersive effects of cardiac and respiratory pulsatile CSF flow
(\Cref{fig:csf}A--C). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Imposing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Beginning with the advective, net flow field driven by 
CSF production, we impose }\DIFaddend a constant CSF \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{production }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{inflow }\DIFaddend of $400\,$ml/day across the surface
of the lateral ventricles\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, while
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Simultaneously }\DIFaddend allowing for efflux across the upper 
convexity \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend yields a total CSF pressure drop of $26\,$mPa (0.00020 mmHg) (\Cref{fig:csf}D) with a
maximum flow velocity of $1.85\,$mm/s (in the aqueduct) and a mean
velocity in the SAS of $2.6$\textmu m/s (\Cref{fig:csf}E). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Next, to }\DIFaddend examine the
dispersive effects of pulsatile CSF flow, we employ the theory of
shear-augmented dispersion together with computational fluid dynamics
to determine a dispersion factor $R$ enhancing the effective solute
diffusivity (see \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Methods). 
For }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Supplementary information S1.3 for a complete description). 
To estimate }\DIFaddend the cardiac contribution, we compute \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the steady state
}\DIFaddend CSF pressure and flow fields at peak systolic blood inflow\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{,
corresponding to a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
Modelling the }\DIFaddend reduction in CSF space volume \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{at a total }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{corresponding to peak systolic
conditions, we assume a total inflow }\DIFaddend rate of $6\,$ml/s~\cite{baledent2014imaging, causemann2022human}
in the SAS \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{across its outer surface }\DIFaddend and $0.31\,$ml/s 
across the lateral ventricle surface\cite{vinje2019respiratory}. 
This scenario sets up a pressure
drop of $10\,$Pa ($0.075$ mmHg) between the lateral ventricles and the
spinal SAS and a maximum flow velocity of $19.8\,$cm/s
(\Cref{fig:csf}F, J). Assuming a cardiac frequency of $1\,$Hz, we
infer that this cardiac-induced pulsatile CSF flow increases the
effective diffusion by more than two orders of magnitude in the
aqueduct and near the cisterna magna, but has little effect ($R <
1$) in most of the SAS (\Cref{fig:csf}G, K). For the respiratory
contribution, we employ the same methodology, but with a total rate of
$1\,$ml/s \cite{gutierrez2022effect} in the SAS and $0.121\,$ml/s
\cite{liu2024using} in the lateral ventricles, yielding a respiratory
peak flow volume of $1.121\,$ ml/s at the craniocervical
junction. While the resulting flow velocities are only about one
fourth of their cardiac-induced counterparts (\Cref{fig:csf}H, L),
respiratory dispersive mixing reaches a factor of up to 320 due the
lower respiratory frequency of $0.25\,$Hz (\Cref{fig:csf}I, M).

Now, to examine how CSF pulsatility affects the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tracer }\DIFaddend enrichment patterns,
we consider three variations of the baseline: (i) no CSF production,
(ii) reduced pulsatility and thus decreased dispersion\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{($0.1 \times
R$)}\DIFdelend , and (iii) higher pulsatility with increased dispersion\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{($10
\times R$)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. We computed the reduced and increased pulsatility scenarios by halving and doubling the inflow rates associated with both cardiac and respiratory pulsations, which changed the dispersion factors by 0.25$\times$ and 4$\times$, respectively. Note that behaviour directly reflects the nature of our model: Stokes flow is linear in its inflow boundary conditions, and the diffusion enhancement factor is quadratic in the predicted pressure gradient}\DIFaddend .
Without CSF production, transport is considerably delayed
(\Cref{fig:csf}N, O). Even after $12$ hours, tracer remains in the
subtentorial regions around the cerebellum, the brain stem and in the
surrounding CSF. Interestingly, the lack of CSF production instead
allows tracer to travel upwards through the ventricular system,
reaching the third ventricle after around $12$ hours. On the other
hand, if the CSF pulsatility is reduced, we observe rapid transport
towards the upper convexity of the cranium, as in the baseline model,
but the tracer spreads exclusively within the anterior regions
(\Cref{fig:csf}P). This feature can be attributed to the CSF flow
bifurcation posterior to the ambient cistern (\Cref{fig:csf}D):
without sufficient diffusion, the tracer is unable to cross into the
posterior SAS. Indeed, with higher dispersion, the tracer moves
through the quadrigeminal cistern and further upwards into the
longitudinal fissure, with also enrichment of the cerebellum
(\Cref{fig:csf}Q).

\label{sec:pvs_flow_results}

The PVSs are recognized across species as critical pathways for solute
transport in and around the brain, and thus as potential targets for
enhancing brain drug delivery and metabolic waste clearance. However,
whether CSF flows more rapidly in PVSs and what the forces and
mechanisms required to drive such flow are, remain as key points of
debate~\cite{bohr2022glymphatic, van2024caa}. Motivated by
experimental observations in animal
models~\cite{iliff2012paravascular, iliff2013cerebral, mestre2018flow,
  bedussi2018paravascular}, there is now a remarkable body of
literature on modelling perivascular fluid flow and
transport~\cite{bilston2003arterial, asgari2016glymphatic,
  rey2018pulsatile, daversin2020mechanisms, sharp2019dispersion,
  thomas2019fluid, kedarasetti2020functional, kedarasetti2020arterial,
  troyetsky2021dispersion, martinac2021phase, gjerde2023directional,
  nozaleda2024arterial}. Here, we ask how these proposed mechanisms
would translate from idealized geometries to human vascular networks
and moreover, evaluate their integrated effect in the context of
intracranial solute transport.

Our periarterial network extends from the internal carotid arteries
and basilar artery through up to 18 bifurcations to reach upstream
network ends located within the SAS or up to 6 mm inside the
parenchyma (\Cref{fig:results1}A--B, \Cref{fig:pvs_a}A) and includes
major surface arteries of radius 0.5--1.4 mm. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Due to imaging limitations, the network primarily covers the supratentorial regions, with the lowest network point located approximately $4\,$cm above the craniocervical junction.
}\DIFaddend Imposing the pressure field induced by CSF production at the periarterial network ends induces slow steady CSF flow of variable direction in these PVSs, with
an average velocity of 0.08 \textmu m/s (antegrade) and a maximum
velocity of 0.55 \textmu m/s (\Cref{fig:pvs_a}B). On the other hand,
traveling waves of arterial wall motion (\Cref{fig:pvs_a}C), such as
the pulse wave or other vasomotion~\cite{vanveluw2020vasomotion,
  munting2023spontaneous, bojarskaite2023sleep,
  broggini2024long,hauglund2025norepinephrine}, also induce net
directional flow in the PVS~\cite{kedarasetti2020arterial,
  kedarasetti2020functional, coenen2021lubrication,
  gjerde2023directional, nozaleda2024arterial} -- of magnitude and
direction depending on the amplitude, frequency, and length of the
waves and the characteristics of the perivascular
network~\cite{gjerde2023directional}. Applying a semi-analytic model
of the net flow induced by peristalsis in perivascular
networks~\cite{gjerde2023directional} (see Methods), we estimate that
the cardiac pulse wave alone, traveling at a frequency of 1 Hz with a
wavelength of 2.0 m and a 1\% wall displacement~\cite{jung2021novel},
will induce mainly antegrade PVS flow with an average net velocity of
0.92 \textmu m/s while reaching up to 7.31 \textmu m/s near larger,
ventral vessels such as the MCA (\Cref{fig:pvs_a}D,E). The same theory
predicts that strong ultraslow vasomotions, if traveling antegrade at
0.1Hz with a wavelength of 0.02 m and a 10\%
displacement~\cite{broggini2024long}, will induce both retrograde and
antegrade net PVS flow with an average velocity of 13.05 \textmu m/s
and maximum velocity 54.44 \textmu m/s (\Cref{fig:pvs_a}D,F).

We study the effect of such rapid PVS flow on intracranial molecular
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{enrichment }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{transport }\DIFaddend by comparing the more conservative baseline model and a
high PVS flow model, where the former still includes the net flow
contributions from CSF production and the cardiac pulse wave, while
the latter additionally includes the ultraslow vasomotion
contribution. In both models, tracers were first observed at the basal
artery after 48 minutes (\Cref{fig:pvs_b}A), defined by their first-time arrival (FTA), the time at which the concentration first exceeds $0.1$ mmol/l. At all upstream locations along the middle cerebral arteries
(MCAs) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA), we found substantially
reduced FTAs with higher PVS flow (\Cref{fig:pvs_b}B), up to 2.5 hours
earlier in the left M2 segment of the MCA. PVS concentrations peaked
before the surrounding tissue (0:48h vs 1:12h at the MCA and 1:00h vs
1:48h at MCA2) with high PVS flow, while these peaks occurred nearly
simultaneously in the baseline model. The earlier appearance and the
delay in time-to-peak between the PVS and surrounding tissue clearly
indicates the directionality of tracer enrichment -- it first arrives
in the PVS and subsequently spreads into the tissue and SAS
(\Cref{fig:pvs_b}C, D), and especially so with higher PVS flow. These
observations also hold on an aggregated level: computing the total
amount of tracer in the PVS as a function of the distance to the
arterial network roots, we find accelerated tracer transport with
higher PVS flow, especially at earlier time points (2--9 hours)
(\Cref{fig:pvs_b}E). Moreover, differences in tracer transport along the
PVS translate to altered enrichment patterns on the whole-organ
scale. For instance, after 4-6 hours, the faster-moving tracer in the
PVS is clearly visible in the space adjacent to the PVS of the ACA, MCA, and other arteries (\Cref{fig:pvs_b}G). In contrast,
there are no clear signs of early enrichment surrounding the PVS in
the baseline model (\Cref{fig:pvs_b}F).

A natural question is whether early PVS enrichment could be the result
of increased dispersion rather than net flow in the
PVS\cite{asgari2016glymphatic,sharp2019dispersion,bojarskaite2023sleep,asgari2016glymphatic,troyetsky2021dispersion}. Interestingly,
even increasing the dispersion factor by $100 \times$ in the PVS,
induced only minor changes in the global spreading rate compared to the
baseline (\Cref{fig:pvs_b}F, H), thus indicating a negative answer to
this question.

\subsection*{Structural versus functional compartmentalization of perivascular spaces}

Human and rodent observations indicate that tracers concentrate in perivascular spaces surrounding the pial and subarachnoid vasculature \cite{zhang1990interrelationships,zhang1992directional, bedussi2017paravascular, mestre2018flow, bedussi2018paravascular, eide2024functional}. However, it remains unclear whether such enrichment patterns necessitate a structural barrier, such as a membrane with limited permeability, or if the patterns could result from enhanced flow or mixing in these areas alone. We therefore next investigate how the permeability of the interface between the PVS and the surrounding CSF affects tracer enrichment around the major arterial trunks (\Cref{fig:compartmentalization}A--B). To this end, we compare models with high and low  permeabilities, representing a highly permeable PVS-CSF interface (functional compartmentalization) and a less permeable interface (structural compartmentalization), respectively. For the low permeability model, we set the permeability to $3.8 \cdot 10^{-7}\,$m/s, consistent with previous estimates for the endfoot sheath surrounding penetrating arterioles \cite{koch2023estimates}, which we consider to be a lower bound for the surface PVS-CSF permeability. For the high permeability model, we increase this permeability by a factor of 100. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We emphasize that, for }\DIFaddend both scenarios, we consider the high PVS flow regime as examined in the previous section. 

At the basal artery (BA), tracer appears within one hour in the surrounding CSF in both models (\Cref{fig:compartmentalization}C, E). With a more permeable PVS-CSF interface, tracer quickly crosses from the CSF into the PVS, resulting in similar peak concentrations of 25\,mmol/l in the PVS and at its outer surface, while values up to 50\,mmol/l are attained in the vicinity. In contrast, the low permeability model exhibits substantially lower perivascular tracer enrichment, with a maximum concentration of 10\,mmol/l after approximately two hours.
%The high permeability model allows for more tracer crossing into the PVS, leading to higher concentrations further downstream. Notably, crossover into the parenchyma is also observed, most clearly at 4 hours.
For the middle cerebral arteries (MCA-R and MCA-L), tracer appears
first in the PVS in both models (\Cref{fig:compartmentalization}D, E),
though with higher concentrations in the high permeability model (up
to 24 mmol/l). We also observe that the higher permeability allows the
tracer to leak out of the PVS and spread within the Sylvian fissure to
a greater extent. With a small delay, more tracer appears via
  the CSF pathway (\Cref{fig:compartmentalization}D). At the anterior cerebral artery (ACA-A2), the first tracer arrival in the PVS occurs after 3 hours, with a peak at 5 hours. The concentration peak in the PVS is tailed by a higher peak in the CSF (\Cref{fig:compartmentalization}E), indicating tracer arrival through a second pathway; i.e., directly through the CSF-filled space outside of the PVS. Similar patterns are observed for ACA-A3.

Summarizing and quantifying these observations
(\Cref{fig:compartmentalization}F), we find that neither the time of
first arrival nor the time-to-peak are substantially affected by the
PVS-CSF permeability at any of the periarterial segments considered
(BA, MCAs, ACAs). However, the concentration difference between the
PVS and its surrounding CSF quickly decreases with higher
permeability, as does the time lag between the concentration peaks in
these domains. Thus, fast transport along the PVS is not contingent
upon a structural compartmentalization of the PVS, whereas a sharp
concentration gradient between PVS and CSF is unlikely without a
restricting barrier.

. More
generally, enlarged PVSs are associated with a range of pathophysiogical
conditions and cognitive decline~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFaddend . A key
question is thus whether enlarged PVSs alone leads to delayed
perivascular and intracranial tracer enrichment. To address this
question from a fluid and transport dynamics perspective, we ask our
in-silico model to predict the integrated effect of perivascular
dilation on PVS flow velocities and tracer enrichment patterns
(\Cref{fig:enlargement}A).

Again we compute CSF production-, cardiac-, and vasomotion-induced net PVS flow velocities, but now in a perivascular geometry with an increased outer radius ($R^{\rm dilated}_2 = 3 R_1$) compared to the previous ($R^{\rm control}_2 = 2 R_1$), which corresponds to a $2.67 \times$ increase in PVS cross-section area.
%% \begin{align*}
%%   A_1 = \pi (R_2^2 - R_1^2) = \pi (2^2 R_1^2 - R_1^2) = 3 \pi R_1^2 \\
%%   A_2 = \pi (\hat{R}_2^2 - R_1^2) = \pi (3^2 R_1^2 - R_1^2) = 8 \pi R_1^2 \\
%%   A_2 / A_1 = 8/3 = 2.76
%% \end{align*}
The enlargement yields notable and non-uniform changes in the flow
dynamics. On the one hand, the pressure-induced flow velocities
increase from a mean of 0.08 \textmu m/s to 0.33 \textmu m/s due to
the reduced effective resistance of the PVS. However, the peristaltic
pumping becomes considerably less effective: the cardiac and
vasomotion-induced net CSF flow velocities drop from a mean of 0.92
\textmu m/s to 0.17 \textmu m/s and from 13.05 \textmu m/s to 2.33
\textmu m/s, respectively (\Cref{fig:enlargement}B--D). In total, the
net CSF velocity reduces, which in turn alters the tracer enrichment
within the dilated PVS. Notably, we observe later tracer arrival in
all MCA segments, with up to 96 min later arrival in the
MCA2s for the high PVS flow scenario (\Cref{fig:enlargement}E, F). For
the baseline model, which omits the vasomotion-induced net PVS flow,
the effect is less pronounced in the MCA but clearly persists and is
evident in the MCA2s (\Cref{fig:enlargement}F). Finally, we note that
the larger volume of the dilated PVS results in a greater total
accumulation of tracer in the PVS from 3--24 hours and reduced
enrichment of the parenchyma at 6 and 12 h, while the mean PVS
concentration is initially lower, but later exceeds the baseline model (\Cref{fig:enlargement}G,H).

\section*{Discussion}

%% Summary of findings
We have presented a high-fidelity in-silico model of molecular
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{enrichment }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{transport }\DIFaddend and clearance in human intracranial spaces, enabling
tailored predictions of the influence of CSF space and (peri)vascular
morphology, physiological factors such as cardiac and respiratory
pulsatility, as well as of pathological conditions such as enlarged
PVSs \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in the SAS}\DIFaddend . A key observation is that the balance between CSF
production and intracranial pulsatility significantly shapes the
large-scale features of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{molecular }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tracer }\DIFaddend enrichment, with e.g.~ventricular
tracer reflux after intrathecal injection in the absence of CSF
production, and preference towards anterior brain regions with reduced
pulsatility. Indeed, the simulated distribution patterns cover a
substantial range of the individual variations observed clinically
\cite{ringstad2018brain}. In terms of perivascular pathways, we find
that even moderate CSF flow on the order of 0.1--1.0 \textmu m/s in
the surface PVSs results in earlier tracer enrichment around major
cerebral arteries. This effect is more pronounced -- with up to a
three-hour difference in time of arrival -- with mean PVS flow rates
of approximately 10 \textmu m/s. Our models of CSF flow in
perivascular networks, based on first principles and asymptotic
analysis, predict net flow of such magnitudes and both antegrade and
retrograde flow within the perivascular network\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{,
occurring with or without pressure differences at the network
ends}\DIFdelend . The PVS may thus
function as highways facilitating rapid transport, even in the absence
of structural barriers, though a sharp concentration difference
between the PVS and surrounding tissues is unlikely without such
barriers. Finally, dilated PVS \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in the SAS }\DIFaddend will cause a substantial reduction in
cardiac- and vasomotion-driven flow velocities, which in turn impedes
perivascular transport.

%% Comparison with others

% Tracer enrichment predictions
While \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{molecular }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tracer }\DIFaddend enrichment of the brain and surrounding CSF spaces
have been extensively studied in animal models, especially in murine
models in connection with studies of the glymphatic system, there are
fewer reports of contrast enrichment in human subjects over 0--24h. We
therefore mainly compare our in-silico predictions with the series of
papers by Eide and colleagues~\cite{ringstad2017glymphatic,
  ringstad2018brain, eide2021sleep, eide2024functional} and Watts et
al~\cite{watts2019measuring}. Ringstad et al.~\cite{ringstad2018brain}
report of tracer enrichment in a centripetal pattern, primarily in
regions near large cerebral surface arteries, peaking in the CSF
spaces between 6 and 9 hours, with parenchymal tracer content still
increasing after 24 hours, but with large individual
differences. Watts et al~\cite{watts2019measuring} report of a similar
enrichment pattern and a concentration peak in the SAS of $\approx$0.5
mmol/l (relative to a total amount of 1.0 mmol) occuring after 10 to 15 hours. 
Our in-silico enrichment patterns agree with these observations, though with an earlier rather than later peak in the CSF spaces (2 hours after first tracer appearance at the craniocervical junction). In particular, we note that the substantial individual variation observed clinically is comparable to the variation in in-silico enrichment patterns associated with reduced CSF production or reduced intracranial pulsatility. We find that about 20\% of the tracer reaching the cranium enters the parenchyma, which aligns with the reported peak concentration values of $0.5\,$mmol/l in the SAS and $0.1\,$mmol/l in the parenchyma reported by Watts et al~\cite{watts2019measuring}.

  nozaleda2024arterial}. In mice, Mestre et al~\cite{mestre2018flow}
observe CSF flow in surface perivascular regions surrounding branches
of the MCA with average flow speeds of 18.7 \textmu m/s and net flow
in the antegrade direction, but also regions with retrograde
flow. Similarly, Bedussi et al.~\cite{bedussi2018paravascular} report
of oscillatory flow, with an average (net) CSF velocity of 17 $\pm$ 2
\textmu m/s in the antegrade direction. Using physics-informed neural
networks, Boster et al~\cite{boster2023artificial} estimate PVS
velocities of $12.75 \pm 6.25$ \textmu m/s. Less is known about the
magnitude and directionality of CSF flow in surface PVSs in
humans. Here, assuming that human surface PVS follow the major surface
vessels and are CSF-filled but otherwise open regions of width
proportional to the vessel radius, our estimates indicate that the CSF
pressure differences due to CSF production, cardiac peristaltic
pumping and low-frequency vasomotion all yield spatially-varying net
CSF flow with both antegrade and retrograde PVS segments. This
observation is thus in agreement with the experimental
observations~\cite{mestre2018flow, bedussi2018paravascular}, and
inherently supports the original notion that antegrade and retrograde
solute transport along PVSs may coexist~\cite{rennels1985evidence}. In
terms of magnitude, the contribution from CSF production and cardiac
wall motion are small (0.08 \textmu m/s and 0.92 \textmu m/s on
average), but intriguingly, our estimates of the contribution from
vasomotion (13.05 \textmu m/s) are comparable to the experimental
reports. We do note that this estimate is based on the presence of
rhythmic waves of vasomotion at a frequency of 0.1Hz, a wavelength of
20 mm, and a wall displacement of 10\% -- in the antegrade direction,
all values currently associated with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{significant

cerebral vasculature, though Gokina et al\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

% Compartmentalization of the PVS
To what extent are surface PVSs in communication with the surrounding
SAS and to what extent are these structurally separated compartments?
Originally, Weller and coauthors~\cite{zhang1990interrelationships,
  zhang1992directional, weller2005microscopic} identified thin sheaths
of pial cells surrounding human surface arteries and penetrating
arterioles (but not veins or venules). On the other hand, Bakker and
coauthors report that the subarachnoid space, the cisterns, ventricles
and penetrating periarteriolar spaces form a continuous CSF
space~\cite{bedussi2017paravascular}. Thorne and colleagues study the
architectures of rat perivascular spaces in detail, emphasizing the
presence of openings (stomata) on the interface between the
vasculature and the CSF within the SAS~\cite{pizzo2018intrathecal,
  hannocks2018molecular}. Further, Mestre et
al~\cite{mestre2022periarteriolar} study the properties of pial
perivascular spaces in mice, and report of pial cells forming sheaths
for larger surface arteries and partially cover smaller surface
arteries, with higher coverage in ventral SAS regions. Our results
demonstrate that the PVSs may act as rapid transport pathways even
with only a partial barrier between the PVS and surrounding CSF, thus
contributing to quantifying the properties of the human PVS-CSF
interface~\cite{eide2024functional}. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In this regard, we emphasize that
we report on the isolated effect of variations in permeability on
molecular transport, separated from any effects on fluid flow in the
PVS. Clearly, one may expect that the presence and/or properties of
such a barrier would affect also PVS flow. However, considering the
uncertainty associated with PVS flow characteristics in the human SAS
in general and the lack of computational models describing net PVS
flow in the presence of fluid exchange, this remains challenging to
quantify.
}\DIFaddend 

% Variations with sleep, exercise
Lifestyle factors such as sleep~\cite{xie2013sleep, miao2024brain,
  bojarskaite2023sleep, eide2021sleep, vinje2023human,
  hauglund2025norepinephrine, larsen2024sleep},
exercise~\cite{holstein2018voluntary, yildiz2022immediate}, and
alcohol intake~\cite{lundgaard2018beneficial} affect molecular
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{enrichment }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{transport }\DIFaddend and clearance of the brain. In particular, pial arteries
display higher-amplitude low-frequency vasomotion during NREM and
intermediate sleep states, while REM sleep is associated with reduced
PVS width~\cite{bojarskaite2023sleep}. Peristaltic pumping is more
effective under both of these configurations, resulting in higher
estimated net PVS flow velocities~\cite{gjerde2023directional}. Even
higher PVS velocities would amplify the PVS flow effects simulated
here, with earlier arrival times along the PVSs, clear enrichment in
adjacent spaces, and accelerated \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{molecular }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tracer }\DIFaddend enrichment
overall. Moreover, sleep is linked with low-frequency oscillations in
human CSF flow~\cite{fultz2019coupled}. As we have shown here, the
level of dispersion in the CSF spaces strongly shapes molecular
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{enrichment }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{transport }\DIFaddend patterns. While we, at baseline, account for the dispersion
induced by cardiac and respiratory pulsatility, the high dispersion
scenarios considered can be viewed as representative of additional
pulsatility induced by e.g.~neural waves~\cite{fultz2019coupled,
  williams2023neural} or other respiration patterns depending on
activity level. More broadly, we consider this as a key strength of
the current in-silico framework: allowing for integrating and
exploring the mechanistic macroscale implications of changes in
pulsatility at smaller spatial or temporal scales.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This approach of modeling pulsatility through an effective dispersion 
factor is a simplification that does not capture the full complexity
of transient fluid dynamics, such as non-uniform wall motion and ependymal
cilia within the ventricular system~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{siyahhan2014flow}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, dynamic CSF
flow at the craniocervical junction, or the effect of microanatomical
features such as subarachnoid trabeculae on flow resistance and dispersion
in the SAS. However, our approach is supported by recent clinical 
observations. High-resolution MRI measurements by Hirschler et
al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{hirschler2024region} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
revealed that CSF mobility in regions
with high pulsatility is approximately tenfold greater than the 
self-diffusion of water, an enhancement factor consistent with 
the values computed in our model. 
}\DIFaddend 

% Not discussed variations with disease states

% Limitations
In terms of limitations, our primary constraint modelling-wise is the
geometric representation of the vascular (and therefore also
perivascular) networks. Concretely, we account for no vessels below
the original MRI resolution limits, and thus only a part of the
cerebral surface vasculature and effectively not the cortical
vessels. In addition, and again due to lack of resolution, there is
uncertainty associated with the location of the vessel segments
relative to the CSF spaces and parenchyma, with some vessels
surrounded by both domains and some vessels completely entering the
parenchyma before returning to the SAS. Higher resolution MRI data
(T1w and e.g. time-of-flight, QSM or other modalities) in more
subjects would immediately allow for more detailed studies of this
aspect. As a result of the lack of an accurate representation of the
cortical and subcortical white matter vasculature, we have considered
a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{conservative }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{basic }\DIFaddend transport model within the parenchyma, modelling extracellular
diffusion alone \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and no bulk interstitial fluid flow}\DIFaddend . To compensate, we
have focused on reporting detailed predictions in the CSF spaces and
surface PVS after not more than 24 hours. In particular, we note that,
we observe tracer accumulation at the perivascular network ends after
12 hours, similar to that previously observed for
microspheres~\cite{bedussi2018paravascular, mestre2018flow}, which
here can be interpreted as an artifact of the incomplete network
creating \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{up }\DIFdelend a barrier for tracer movement. Previously, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{by inferring
transport parameters within the human brain from glymphatic MRI data,
}\DIFaddend we have found that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{enrichment }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{molecular transport }\DIFaddend within the parenchyma is
well-represented by $\approx 3\times$ enhanced diffusion augmented by
local clearance e.g.~across the blood-brain barrier\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{or }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, or by
}\DIFaddend diffusion-convection with a complex pattern of spatially-varying
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{convective velocities }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{interstitial fluid flow on the order }\DIFaddend of 1-10 \textmu
m/min~\cite{vinje2023human}. We will incorporate such transport
mechanisms within the parenchyma in future work. Finally, we also note
that we simulate the intracranial distribution of a tracer
concentration appearing at the craniocervical junction rather than as
an intrathecal injection. We \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{thus neglect absorption of both CSF and
tracer in the spinal compartment, and }\DIFaddend therefore overestimate the
amount of tracer entering into the intracranial spaces; however, due
to the linearity of the mathematical model, it is valid to directly
interpret the in-silico concentrations relative to the total amount of
tracer.

% Outlook
In conclusion, our findings transfer insights from experimental
studies and theoretical analysis to the in-silico human setting,
reconcile seemingly conflicting observations in particular relating to
directionality of perivascular flow, and integrate different physical
mechanisms across \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{across }\DIFdelend spatial and temporal scales. The complete simulation
pipeline is openly available, including interactive visualization of
simulation results for all model variations~\cite{ZENODO}. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Future work
will focus on further model validation including comparisons between
in-silico predictions and glymphatic MRI for a number of subjects
across several patient cohorts. }\DIFaddend Looking ahead, this platform
establishes a foundation for in-silico studies of molecular movement
within the human brain environment, such as tailored predictions of
intrathecal chemotherapy delivery or personalized diagnostics of brain
clearance capacity.


\section*{Methods}

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This section gives a condensed summary of the in-silico modelling
framework. For a complete description of the mathematical models and
simulation scenarios, we refer to the Supplementary information S1.
}

\DIFaddend \subsection*{Intracranial compartments: ventricular system, SAS, and brain parenchyma}

From T1-weighted MR images of a 26-year-old, healthy male volunteer~\cite{hodneland2019new},
we first automatically segment the brain parenchyma and CSF spaces,
including the ventricular system and SAS, using
Synthseg~\cite{billot2023robust,billot2023synthseg}
(\Cref{fig:results1}A--B). We next manually adjust the segmentation to
accurately represent the connections and barriers between CSF spaces (aqueduct,
median aperture, tentorium cerebelli), smoothen, and finally extract
surface representations of the outer (arachnoid) boundary, the pial
membrane and other interfaces. Conforming to these surface and
interface representations, we generate a tetrahedral mesh $\Omega$
representing the complete intracranial volume as the union of the
parenchyma $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$ and CSF spaces $\Omega_{\rm CSF}$, using
fTetWild~\cite{hu2020fast} (\Cref{fig:csf}A--B). The resulting
computational mesh consists of $233\,592$ vertices and $1\,290\,131$
mesh cells, which vary between $0.22$ mm and $8.9$ mm in mesh cell
diameter. The parenchyma has a total volume of $1318$ ml, whereas the
ventricles and the outer SAS contribute $32$ ml and $329$ ml,
respectively, to a total CSF volume of $361$ml, in agreement with
recent estimates~\cite{hladky2024regulation}.

\subsection*{Periarterial and perivenous spaces}

To represent surface networks of periarterial and perivenous spaces,
we use Kiminaro~\cite{william_silversmith_2021_5539913} to separately
skeletonize time-of-flight angiography (ToF) and quantitative
susceptibility mapping (QSM) images from the same human
subject~\cite{hodneland2019new}. This technique yields networks of
one-dimensional curves, each curve $\Lambda^i$ indicating the
centerline of a blood vessel segment and labeled with its lumen radius
$R_1^i$ (\Cref{fig:pvs_a}A). We also assign an
outer radius $R_2^i > R_1^i$ to each segment $i$, form the annular
cylinder ensheathing $\Lambda^i$ and define the union of these as the
PVS. The periarterial network graph consists of $12\,708$ edges
connected at $12\,562$ inner nodes and with $147$ end nodes, and the
associated domain is denoted by $\Lambda_a$. We identify three of the
end nodes -- corresponding to the two internal carotid arteries (ICAs)
and the basilar artery (BA) -- as root nodes, and designate the other
ends as leaf nodes. The resulting perivenous network graph consists of
$24\,829$ edges connected at $23\,881$ inner nodes and with $949$ end nodes, and the associated domain is denoted by $\Lambda_v$. Finally, we label the outer surface of the PVSs associated with $\Lambda_a$ and $\Lambda_v$, by $\Gamma_a$ and $\Gamma_v$ respectively.

\subsection*{Dispersion in the CSF spaces \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{induced by pulsatile CSF flow}\DIFaddend }

The pulsatile flow of CSF in the SAS and ventricular system,
associated with the cardiac and respiratory cycles, substantially
enhances molecular diffusion through
dispersion~\cite{taylor1953dispersion, watson1983diffusion,
  asgari2016glymphatic, sharp2019dispersion, ray2021quantitative,

\subsection*{Perivascular fluid flow induced by arterial wall motion}

Using the theoretical framework introduced by Gjerde et
al.~\cite{gjerde2023directional}, we also compute analytic estimates
for the time-average perivascular flow rate $\langle Q' \rangle$
induced by peristalsis in the arterial network $\Lambda_a$; i.e.~the
net flow induced by traveling waves of arterial wall motion of
frequency $f$, amplitude $\varepsilon$ and wave lengths $\lambda$
(\Cref{fig:pvs_a}C). The corresponding contribution to the
periarterial flow velocity is defined for each segment $\Lambda_i$ as
$\langle Q'_i \rangle/A_i$ where $A_i = \pi (R_2^i - R_1^i)$ is the
cross-section area of the PVS segment and $\langle Q_i' \rangle$ is
the estimated mean flow rate (see Supplementary information S1.4
\DIFaddbegin \emph{\DIFadd{Estimating net perivascular flow induced by peristaltic waves}}

\DIFadd{We represent the evolution and distribution of a solute in the CSF
spaces $\Omega_{\rm CSF}$, brain parenchyma $\Omega_{\rm PAR}$, and

current model accounts for solute exchange between the CSF spaces,
brain parenchyma, and the PVSs, diffusion within all compartments,
dispersion and convection in the CSF spaces, and convection within the
PVS. Specifically, for $t > 0$, we solve for a concentration field
$c(x, t)$ in the 3D intracranial compartments (for $x \in \Omega_{\rm
  CSF} \cup \Omega_{\rm PAR}$) and for a cross section-averaged
concentration field $\hat{c}(s, t)$ in the perivascular networks (for
$s \in \Lambda_a, \Lambda_v$) satisfying the following equations:

\subsection*{\DIFadd{Molecular clearance from the intracranial space and perivascular network ends}}

\DIFadd{We model molecular clearance, into the meningeal lymphatics or other
pathways, across the upper, outer (arachnoid) boundary
(\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

concentration in the SAS with a rate constant $\beta_{\rm exit}$. We
set a no-flux condition at the end nodes of the perivascular networks,
not allowing for direct molecular clearance there.

\subsection*{\DIFadd{Intracranial influx after intrathecal injection}}
\DIFadd{To represent molecular influx into the intracranial compartments
following intrathecal injection, without modelling the spinal
compartment explicitly, we prescribe a time-dependent molecular influx
over the interface towards the spinal CSF compartment with the condition
}\begin{equation*}
  \DIFadd{(D \nabla c - \bm u_{\rm CSF} c ) \cdot \bm{n} = g_{\mathrm{influx}},  \quad \mathrm{on}  \quad \Gamma_{\mathrm{SSAS}}.
}\end{equation*}
\DIFadd{Here we set
}\begin{equation}
  \DIFadd{g_\mathrm{influx}(t) = \frac{m_{\rm tot}}{T_{\rm max}^2 |\Gamma_{\rm SSAS}|} \max(0, T_{\rm max} - |t - T_{\rm max}|), 
  \label{eq:g}
}\end{equation}
\DIFadd{which expresses a hat-shaped influx function with a peak at $T_{\max}$ and a total tracer injection of $m_{\rm tot}$ (\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\Cref{tab:parameters}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
). We here consider a fixed $T_{\max} = 1.0$ h in~}\eqref{eq:g}\DIFadd{, and do not consider the effect of e.g.~reduced pulsatility on spinal transit time.

\subsection*{Numerical approximation, implementation, and verification}

We give a concise summary of the numerical approach here (see
Supplementary methods for a comprehensive description). To
solve~\eqref{eq:multi_transport} numerically, we use the interior
penalty discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with weighted averages and
upwinding for the convection term in the 3D
domains~\cite{ern2009discontinuous} -- to ensure numerical stability
and minimize the artificial presence of negative concentration
values. For the 1D domain, we use continuous finite element spaces
defined over each of the networks and stabilized with numerical
diffusion when $\hat{u}$ is non--zero. Note that the 3D--1D coupling
in~\eqref{eq:multi_transport} leads to a 3D solution $c$ with low
regularity properties. Thus, one can only expect lower-order error
convergence near $\Lambda_a$ and $\Lambda_v$, see the references
\cite{masri2024discontinuous} and \cite{laurino2019derivation} for the
numerical analysis of DG and continuous Galerkin schemes,
respectively. However, away from these 1D networks, almost optimal
approximation is
expected~\cite{masri2023discontinuous,koppl2016local}. To numerically
solve the Stokes equations to compute the CSF flow velocity and
pressure in the ventricular system and SAS, we use finite element
spaces that preserve the incompressibility condition on the discrete
level~\cite{hong2016robust}. This requirement is important for
numerical stability when subsequently
solving~\eqref{eq:multi_transport}\cite{cesmelioglu2022compatible}.
The spaces we used for the velocity are continuous along the normal
direction; continuity of the tangential component is enforced via
interior penalty approaches~\cite{hong2016robust}. Optimal
approximation properties are expected for this scheme. These numerical
methods were implemented using the FEniCS finite element
framework~\cite{alnaes2015fenics}, and the 3D-1D coupling is handled
by the extension FEniCS\textsubscript{ii}~\cite{kuchta2020assembly}.
The correctness and accuracy of the numerical solutions were verified
by a series of numerical verification experiments (see Supplementary
information S1.5).

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The majority of the simulation time was spent on the Stokes flow and transport model simulations. Each Stokes flow simulation utilizes a hybrid parallel approach with 16 MPI processes and 4 threads each, requiring approximately 300 GB of RAM and completing in 23 minutes. The transport model is limited to serial execution by FEniCS\textsubscript{ii}, but employs 16 threads for the linear system factorization, taking 22 minutes and consuming about 50 GB of memory on a AMD EPYC 9684X machine.

\DIFaddend \subsection*{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Model validation}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Comparison with literature results}\DIFaddend }

As the primary means of model validation, we compare the in-silico
predictions of tracer enrichment and clearance against glymphatic MRI
studies (Discussion). In addition, we compare auxiliary model
quantities (CSF flow rates and pressure differences, dispersion factor
estimates, and the shapes and sizes of PVSs) with the current
literature (see Supplementary information S2.1).
