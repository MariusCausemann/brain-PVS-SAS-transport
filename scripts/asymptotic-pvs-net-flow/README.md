About
=====

This collection of Python scripts implements the analytical estimates
for directional flow induced by peristalsis in perivascular networks
described in:

  Gjerde, Ingeborg G., Marie E. Rognes, and Antonio L. Sánchez. "The
  directional flow generated by peristalsis in perivascular
  networks—Theoretical and numerical reduced-order descriptions."
  Journal of Applied Physics 134.17 (2023).
  
The code is based on an original implementation by Gjerde and Rognes
available at
https://github.com/scientificcomputing/perivascular-peristalsis
(extracted Feb 1 2024).
